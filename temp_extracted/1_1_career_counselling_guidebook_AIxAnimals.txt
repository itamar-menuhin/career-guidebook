Cause area: Animal × AI quick-start (v1)

1) What it’s trying to achieve (plain language)

Use AI to reduce animal suffering (farmed and wild) by improving how we measure welfare, prevent harms, target advocacy, and design interventions — while also being careful about ways AI deployment can accidentally increase suffering (e.g., scale effects, mismeasurement, perverse incentives). (Animal Charity Evaluators)

2) What kinds of work exist here (role shapes)

Applied ML for wild animal welfare: human–wildlife conflict mitigation, monitoring welfare indicators (e.g., vocalizations), detection/early warning systems. (Rethink Priorities)

AI in farmed animal systems: how AI in agriculture/aquaculture changes welfare (sometimes better, sometimes worse), plus interventions to steer it. (Rethink Priorities)

AI for animal advocacy orgs: LLM-enabled research workflows, message testing, supporter comms, grantwriting support, ops automation (done carefully). (Faunalytics)

Research & strategy at think tanks (what AI applications are promising, where are risks/unknowns). (Rethink Priorities)

Programs / community / hackathons for building tools and pipelines for animal protection. (Electric Sheep)

3) What a “good fit” often looks like (signals)

You like concrete technical leverage (data/ML) and you’re motivated by animals.

You’re comfortable with “applied + messy” domains (datasets, field conditions, imperfect metrics).

You can hold a balanced stance: “AI can help” and “AI can harm if used carelessly.” (Animal Charity Evaluators)



4) Experiments (canonical picks + optional alt)

Experiment A — 1-hour overview (choose 1)

Canonical picks

Animal Charity Evaluators — “The impacts of AI on animal advocacy” (high-level framing of upsides/risks; good first map). (Animal Charity Evaluators)

Rethink Priorities — AI for human–wildlife conflict mitigations (concrete examples; “here’s what AI-for-animals can look like”). (Rethink Priorities)

Optional alt (if they want “how advocates already use AI”)

Faunalytics — “AI and Animal Advocacy” (survey-style view of current usage patterns). (Faunalytics)

Experiment B — longer exposure (choose 1)

Canonical pick (evidence/field grounding)

Rethink Priorities series: “How AI is affecting farmed aquatic animals” (deep dive on innovation → deployment → welfare effects; very “EA research-y”). (Rethink Priorities)

Optional alt (structured program)

AI×Animals Fellowship (8-week remote program focused on AI × animal welfare careers). (Effective Altruism)

Futurekind AI Fellowship (12-week program on using AI for animal protection & environment; listed on EA Opportunities). (Effective Altruism)(These structured programs are newer; I’m including them because they’re explicitly advertised in EA channels, but they’re not as long-established as core 80k/AAC resources.) (Effective Altruism)

Experiment C — project pathway (make it concrete; good for “I need a push”)

Canonical pick (low barrier, EA-aligned research contribution)

Use a Rethink Priorities “AI for animals” angle to produce a small artifact:

1–2 page scoping note (“which AI application + what welfare mechanism + what uncertainties?”)

or a lightweight literature/landscape map that could be shared with an org/funder. (Rethink Priorities)

Canonical pick (concrete + clearly external)

Felidae Fund — volunteer AI/ML specialist processing camera imagery for animal population research (explicit volunteer role with real use). Felidae Conservation Fund+1

Optional alt

Find one anchor piece (from Experiment A/B), then write 10 bullets: “promising application → mechanism → biggest risk/unknown → what a small project could be.”

Experiment D — job-board exploration (bridge theory → action)

Canonical picks (choose 1–2)

80,000 Hours job board (filter for animal welfare, or AI/data roles in adjacent orgs).

Animal Advocacy Careers job board (search for data/tech roles; also helps you learn org landscape). (Animal Advocacy Careers)

Cause area: Global Health & Development quick-start (v1)

1) What it’s trying to achieve (plain language)

Reduce large-scale suffering and premature death by scaling interventions that are cheap, evidence-backed, and logistically feasible (e.g., malaria prevention/treatment, vaccinations, nutrition). (80,000 Hours)

2) What kinds of work exist here (role shapes)

Program implementation & field ops (distribution, logistics, monitoring)

Research & evaluation (development econ, epidemiology, cost-effectiveness, RCTs)

Grantmaking / philanthropy (moving money well; vetting)

Policy and government implementation (health systems, procurement, public finance)

Entrepreneurship / founding new orgs (esp. “evidence-to-scale” nonprofits) (80,000 Hours)

3) What a “good fit” often looks like (signals)

You’re motivated by measurable impact and are OK with “unsexy” operational realities (supply chains, compliance, systems)

You like working with messy real-world constraints and still making steady progress

You enjoy evidence and tradeoffs (not only “what’s morally urgent” but also “what works”) (80,000 Hours)



4) Experiments (A–D)

Experiment A — introductory resource (< 1 hour): wide overview + test interest

Choose 1:

80,000 Hours problem profile: Health in poor countries (Global health) (read/skim) (80,000 Hours)

YouTube: GiveWell finds highly cost-effective charities — here’s how (good for the “why evidence?” mindset) (YouTube)Optional alt (more “why give effectively” than GH-specific): Peter Singer TED talk (via The Life You Can Save) (The Life You Can Save)

Entrepreneurship orientation video (<1h)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKmKLcYoixs

Experiment C — pathway to doing a project (for proof-of-fit + momentum)

Best for: people who need action to stay motivated, want quick proof-of-fit, or need a push past impostor syndrome.

Here “measurable good” is often easiest via moving money effectively or creating a real-world mobilization, since many top orgs don’t offer easy small volunteer tasks.

Cause area: Climate quick-start (v1)

1) What it’s trying to achieve (plain language)

Rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions (and support adaptation where it’s most valuable) by pushing on the highest-leverage bottlenecks: policy, clean energy deployment, targeted innovation, and (in some cases) carbon removal. Both 80,000 Hours and Probably Good emphasize that career choice tends to matter more than personal footprint, and that some climate actions are much more effective than others. 80,000 Hours+1

2) What kinds of work exist here (role shapes)

A useful “menu” (not a checklist):

Policy / government / regulation (often very leveraged; hard to attribute impact, but can be huge). Probably Good+1

Climate-focused engineering / tech (clean power, industrial decarbonization, storage, etc.). Probably Good+1

Research (climate science, modelling, carbon removal R&D, or “what actually works” analysis). 80,000 Hours+1

Advocacy / communications (especially around “neglected-but-effective” interventions). 80,000 Hours+1

Climate finance / impact investing (moving large sums can matter; also easy to do “busy work,” so select carefully). Probably Good+1

Community / field-building (helping others enter or coordinate effectively). Work on Climate+1

3) What “good fit” often looks like (signals)

You’re willing to be a bit strategic (choosing which slice of climate to push on, not just “anything climate”). Probably Good+1

You can tolerate imperfect feedback loops (policy + systems change can be slow and hard to measure). Probably Good+1

You like high-leverage work: “one decision / one institution → very large downstream effects.”
