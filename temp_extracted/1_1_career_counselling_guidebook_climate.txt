Cause area: Climate quick-start (v1)

1) What it’s trying to achieve (plain language)

Rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions (and support adaptation where it’s most valuable) by pushing on the highest-leverage bottlenecks: policy, clean energy deployment, targeted innovation, and (in some cases) carbon removal. Both 80,000 Hours and Probably Good emphasize that career choice tends to matter more than personal footprint, and that some climate actions are much more effective than others. 80,000 Hours+1

2) What kinds of work exist here (role shapes)

A useful “menu” (not a checklist):

Policy / government / regulation (often very leveraged; hard to attribute impact, but can be huge). Probably Good+1

Climate-focused engineering / tech (clean power, industrial decarbonization, storage, etc.). Probably Good+1

Research (climate science, modelling, carbon removal R&D, or “what actually works” analysis). 80,000 Hours+1

Advocacy / communications (especially around “neglected-but-effective” interventions). 80,000 Hours+1

Climate finance / impact investing (moving large sums can matter; also easy to do “busy work,” so select carefully). Probably Good+1

Community / field-building (helping others enter or coordinate effectively). Work on Climate+1

3) What “good fit” often looks like (signals)

You’re willing to be a bit strategic (choosing which slice of climate to push on, not just “anything climate”). Probably Good+1

You can tolerate imperfect feedback loops (policy + systems change can be slow and hard to measure). Probably Good+1

You like high-leverage work: “one decision / one institution → very large downstream effects.”



4) Experiments (A–D)

Experiment A — introductory (< 1 hour): broad overview + test interest

Pick 1:

Probably Good — Climate Change: Impact-Focused Overview (EA-ish framing + “what to do about it”). Probably Good

80,000 Hours — Climate change problem profile (skim summary + “best ways of working” sections). 80,000 Hours

Optional YouTube (good-enough, non-EA but clear):

Project Drawdown — Climate Solutions 101 (watch 1 episode that matches their curiosity). YouTube

Experiment B — longer exposure (course/fellowship/series)
