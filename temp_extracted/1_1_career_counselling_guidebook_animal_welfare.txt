Cause area: Animal Welfare quick-start (v1)

1) What it’s trying to achieve (plain language)

Reduce large-scale animal suffering — especially in areas where many animals are affected (e.g., factory farming), by changing policies, corporate practices, consumer behavior, and the systems that determine how animals are treated. 80,000 Hours+1

2) What kinds of work exist here (role shapes)

Campaigns & corporate outreach (commitments, implementation, accountability)

Policy / legal / government relations

Research & analysis (what works, which tactics, which species/interventions)

Communications / storytelling / movement building

Operations / management / fundraising (often a major bottleneck)

Science/alt-protein/food systems (depending on the person)

Animal x AI – different cause area

3) What a good fit often looks like (signals)

Strong “moral pull” toward animals + willingness to engage practical levers (institutions, corporations, policy)

Comfort with advocacy, persuasion, and coordination (many roles are people-facing)

Or: strong “evidence-minded” instinct (measurement, research, strategy) Faunalytics+1
