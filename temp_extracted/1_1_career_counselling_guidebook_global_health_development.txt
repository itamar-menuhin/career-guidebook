Cause area: Global Health & Development quick-start (v1)

1) What it’s trying to achieve (plain language)

Reduce large-scale suffering and premature death by scaling interventions that are cheap, evidence-backed, and logistically feasible (e.g., malaria prevention/treatment, vaccinations, nutrition). (80,000 Hours)

2) What kinds of work exist here (role shapes)

Program implementation & field ops (distribution, logistics, monitoring)

Research & evaluation (development econ, epidemiology, cost-effectiveness, RCTs)

Grantmaking / philanthropy (moving money well; vetting)

Policy and government implementation (health systems, procurement, public finance)

Entrepreneurship / founding new orgs (esp. “evidence-to-scale” nonprofits) (80,000 Hours)

3) What a “good fit” often looks like (signals)

You’re motivated by measurable impact and are OK with “unsexy” operational realities (supply chains, compliance, systems)

You like working with messy real-world constraints and still making steady progress

You enjoy evidence and tradeoffs (not only “what’s morally urgent” but also “what works”) (80,000 Hours)



4) Experiments (A–D)

Experiment A — introductory resource (< 1 hour): wide overview + test interest

Choose 1:

80,000 Hours problem profile: Health in poor countries (Global health) (read/skim) (80,000 Hours)

YouTube: GiveWell finds highly cost-effective charities — here’s how (good for the “why evidence?” mindset) (YouTube)Optional alt (more “why give effectively” than GH-specific): Peter Singer TED talk (via The Life You Can Save) (The Life You Can Save)

Entrepreneurship orientation video (<1h)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKmKLcYoixs

Experiment B — longer exposure: understand the field with more granularity

Choose 1:

(Non-EA but solid grounding) Coursera: An Introduction to Global Health (structured modules; builds vocabulary + systems map) (Coursera)

Crash Course playlist: Public Health (lighter but sticky; good for people who prefer video series) (YouTube)

Experiment C — pathway to doing a project (for proof-of-fit + momentum)

Best for: people who need action to stay motivated, want quick proof-of-fit, or need a push past impostor syndrome.

Here “measurable good” is often easiest via moving money effectively or creating a real-world mobilization, since many top orgs don’t offer easy small volunteer tasks.

Canonical pick

Run a small fundraising/donation drive for GiveWell Top Charities / Top Charities FundMeasurable outcome: $ donated (or matched) + number of donors. GiveWell explicitly routes donations to its recommended opportunities. GiveWell+2GiveWell+2

Optional alt

GWWC Pledge Drive as a community action experiment (measurable: pledges taken + giving committed). Giving What We Can+1





Experiment D — explore specific job boards (intuition + bridge to action)

Pick 1–2:

80,000 Hours job board (good EA filter for high-impact roles) (80,000 Hours)

ReliefWeb jobs (humanitarian + development roles; good breadth) (ReliefWeb)

Devex job search (global development-focused job board) (Devex)

Impactpool (UN + international orgs; public health roles) (Impactpool)

Tiny scanning method (10–25 min): collect 8–12 roles → label role-types → circle 3 roles + 2 repeating skill gaps → turn into one “direction to test” + one next step.

Notes (your internal):
