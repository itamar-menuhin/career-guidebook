# Wrap + written summary template (locked)

## During the wrap (live)
- “Let me summarize what we have so far — stop me if I misrepresent anything.”
- Write it down together (you type while you talk).

## Written summary (shared live or sent after)

### Snapshot
#### Current situation
#### What you’re aiming for (near-term)
#### Must-haves (what good work needs to include)
#### Constraints (timeline/bandwidth/location/financial stability)

### Promising directions (2–4)

### For each direction
#### Direction (1 sentence)
#### Why it might fit (1–2 bullets)
#### Next steps (1–2 low-cost steps)
#### Resources / links to support the next steps (as needed)
- Go through the next steps and list any relevant links/resources you should send (no fixed limit).
- Rule of thumb: links exist to make next steps easier, not as extra reading.

### People to talk to / intros (if any)

### Door open
- “If questions come up after you digest this, feel free to message.”
- Optional: “If it would help, we can do a check-in later.”
