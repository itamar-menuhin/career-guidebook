**Goal:** Multiply the impact of high-leverage researchers or leaders.

**When to suggest:**

- They thrive on **execution and efficiency** ("I love making things run smoothly").
- They are low-ego and service-oriented; happy to be "behind the scenes" if it means the mission succeeds.
- They are good generalists who can handle everything from logistics to HR.

**The Move:** Find the bottleneck. Look for high-impact teams that are slowed down by admin/process friction.

**First Small Step:** Identify 3 organizations you admire and look for "Operations", "Chief of Staff", or "Program Manager" roles. Read the descriptions—do they sound like drudgery or a fun puzzle?
