**Goal:** Use earning power to fund high-impact work done by others.

**When to use:**

- High-income track.
- Can't work directly on the problem but want to support it.
- Motivated by financial freedom/flexibility.

**The Move:** Choose a path to increase income and commit to donating a percentage.

**Examples:** Tech/Finance/Consulting + pledge 10-20%; Join Giving What We Can.

**Small First Step:** Run a "commitment pilot" (e.g., 1% / month). Research one effective fund/org.
