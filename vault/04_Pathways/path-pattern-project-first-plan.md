**Goal:** Start something small, self-initiated, to test an idea or fill a gap.

**When to use:**

- Identified a clear problem.
- Want to build something tangible without long-term commitment.
- Want to show initiative.

**The Move:** Plan a focused 2–6 week project with a clear output (Guide, Tool, Pilot).

**Small First Step:** Draft the project idea with a well-defined end point—and get feedback from one insider.
