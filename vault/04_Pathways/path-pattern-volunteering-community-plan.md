**Goal:** Build specific career capital (foot in the door) and maintain motivation through direct impact.

**When to suggest:**

- They want to work at a specific organization but aren't qualified for a full-time role yet.
- They need connection to the cause to stay motivated (feeling the "positive impact" loop).
- They want to test "culture fit" with a specific team while building a network.

**The Move:** "Strategic Volunteering". Don't just do generic tasks; take on a role that builds relevant skills (e.g. helping with comms for an AI safety org) or places them in the room with the people they want to work with.

**First Small Step:** Identify one high-priority organization or community node. Ask: "What is a project I could volunteer for that would actually let me work with the team I want to join?"
