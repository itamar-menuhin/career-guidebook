**Goal:** Break isolation, get "known" in the community, and surface hidden opportunities.

**When to suggest:**

- They are stuck in "Analysis Paralysis" (reading endlessly).
- They are introverted or isolated and need to build a "social proof" layer.
- They need a "reality check" on their ideas from actual practitioners.

**The Move:** "The Visibility Sprint". Focus on **outbound** connection. The goal is to break the seal and become a familiar face/name in the ecosystem.

**First Small Step:** The "Low-Stakes Comment": Find a forum post, article, or slack thread in the community and leave one thoughtful, positive comment or question. (Get used to participating).
