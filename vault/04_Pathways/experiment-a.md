**Goal:** Check if a field/problem interests you with minimal investment.

**When to use:**

- You are curious but unsure if it's worth going deep.
- You feel overwhelmed/don't know where to start.

**The Move:** Select one strong intro—article, video, or problem description—and consume it with focus.

**Small First Step:** Find one strong intro resource. Watch/Read it. Ask yourself: "Do I want more of this?"
