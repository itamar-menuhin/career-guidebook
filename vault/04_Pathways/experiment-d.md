**Goal:** Turn general ideas into real roles—and identify skill gaps.

**When to use:**

- You don't know what the jobs look like in practice.
- You want to know what orgs really search for.

**The Move:** Review real job ads to spot patterns (without applying yet).

**Small First Step:** Pick a relevant board, scan 10 ads, and write down 3–5 things that appear repeatedly.
