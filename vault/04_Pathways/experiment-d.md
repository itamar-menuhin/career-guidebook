**Goal:** Ground theory in reality by seeing actual job requirements and organizational "shapes".

**When to suggest:**

- They are in the "Research" phase but have a fuzzy idea of what roles actually look like.
- They want to identify "skill gaps" by comparing their CV to a real job description.
- They feel like a field is "unreachable"—seeing the actual requirements can often demystify it.

**The Move:** Identify 2–3 high-signal job boards for their cause area (e.g. 80k, EA Jobs, specific NGO sites). Filter for their level *and* one level above to see the trajectory.

**First Small Step:** Scan 10 job descriptions. Don't apply; just look for patterns in the "Essential Skills" and "What you'll do" sections.
