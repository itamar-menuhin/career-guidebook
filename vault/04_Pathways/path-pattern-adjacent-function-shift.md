**Goal:** Use your knowledge of the field to solve a different type of problem.

**When to suggest:**

- They understand the "context" well but don't enjoy their current specific day-to-day role (e.g., a researcher who prefers coordinating).
- They see a gap in the field (e.g., "Great research, but no one is communicating it") that matches their natural strengths.

**The Move:** Keep the **cause** (AI, Global Health, etc.) but change the **role**.
*   *Examples:* Academic Researcher → Program Manager; Software Engineer → Technical Governance; Journalist → Comms/Advocacy.

**First Small Step:** **Specific Job Description Check**: Find a role in the "new function" within an organization they respect. Do they meet ~50% of the requirements just from their context knowledge?
