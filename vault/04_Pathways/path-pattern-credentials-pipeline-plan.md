**Goal:** Get the "badge" needed to enter a gated field.

**When to suggest:**
- They want to enter a field with hard gates (e.g. Bio-labs, Policy, Academia).
- They are missing a formal qualification that is non-negotiable (e.g. PhD, Security Clearance).
- They are willing to play the "long game" (2-5 years).

**The Move:** Identify the **minimum effective** credential. Don't just "get a Masters"; get the specific degree from the specific programs that target employers hire from.

**First Small Step:** "Reverse Engineer the Role": Find 5 people with the job you want on LinkedIn and map exactly what degrees/certifications they have.
