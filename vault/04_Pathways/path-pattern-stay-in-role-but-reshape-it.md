**Goal:** Optimize for impact/learning without the friction of a pivot.

**When to suggest:**
- The candidate has high "social capital" in their current org.
- There is a clear "impact gap" they can fill (e.g., starting an implementation group).
- Personal constraints (e.g. visa, financial, location) make a pivot risky right now.

**The Move:** Look for "levers" within the current org. Can they negotiate 20% of their time toward a specific project? Can they maintain the role but switch focus to a higher-priority problem?

**First Small Step:** Identify the "YES-man"—who in the org has the power to say yes to a project shift, and what do they care about?
