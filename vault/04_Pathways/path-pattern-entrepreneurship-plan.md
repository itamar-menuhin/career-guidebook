**Goal:** Check if building something new is your path to impact.

**When to use:**

- Energized by ownership.
- Have an idea (or want help finding one).
- Open to "starting from zero".

**The Move:** Start validating a problem space. Alternatively, apply to an incubator (like AIM).

**Examples:** Apply to sourcing/incubation programs; Talk to users; Create MVP.

**Small First Step:** Watch intro video/read material from incubators. Plan roadmap for MVP.
