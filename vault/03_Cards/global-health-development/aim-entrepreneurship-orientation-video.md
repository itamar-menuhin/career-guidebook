EA-endorsed “taste test” for entrepreneurship: helps someone quickly see what entrepreneurship-for-impact could look like, and whether it feels energizing.

## When to suggest
- Candidate is open to entrepreneurship (for-profit or nonprofit), even as a “maybe”
- Candidate wants a low-cost way to test fit without committing to a program
- Candidate is considering routes like “start a project,” “build a product,” or “launch an org”

## When not to
- Candidate has clearly said they don’t want entrepreneurship
- Candidate is currently overloaded and even a small new direction would feel stressful (then keep it as a later option)

## Notes (internal)
This works well as the “Experiment A” for entrepreneurship because it can advocate better than you can and gives the candidate a shared reference point before you explore heavier options (e.g., Charity Entrepreneurship).
