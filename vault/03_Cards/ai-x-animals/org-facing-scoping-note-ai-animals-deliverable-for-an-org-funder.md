A small research artifact meant to be used (shared with an org/funder), not a personal exercise.

## When to suggest
- Candidate needs action to stay motivated / wants proof-of-fit quickly
- Candidate can write clearly and wants a “bridge” from reading → doing impact
- Candidate has impostor syndrome and benefits from a bounded contribution

## When not to
- Candidate won’t share outputs externally (then it risks becoming a personal learning project)
