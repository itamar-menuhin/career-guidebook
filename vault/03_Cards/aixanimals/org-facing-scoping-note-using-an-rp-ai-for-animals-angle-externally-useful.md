## One-line pitch

A small research artifact meant to be used (shared with an org/funder), not a personal exercise.

## When to suggest

Candidate needs action to stay motivated / wants proof-of-fit quickly Candidate can write clearly and wants a “bridge” from reading → doing impact Candidate has impostor syndrome and benefits from a bounded contribution
