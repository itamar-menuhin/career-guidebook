A structured way to get momentum via real volunteering across functions (including research/data analytics). Work on Climate+1

## When to suggest
- Candidate needs action early / wants proof-of-fit / wants a push
- Candidate wants a community container to stay motivated

## When not to
- Candidate is already overloaded and volunteering would add stress (then do a job-board scan first)
- Read the volunteering page and identify 1–2 roles you could plausibly do; draft a 5-line “how I can help” note.
