Fewer climate listings, but often higher “EA filter” and good for adjacent high-impact roles. Climatebase.org

## When to suggest
- Candidate wants high-signal roles and is open to adjacent paths

## When not to
- Candidate wants climate-only breadth first (use Climatebase)
- Scan 8–12 roles → label → circle 3 roles + 2 repeating skill gaps → convert to 1 direction + 1 next step.
