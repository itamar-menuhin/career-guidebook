Curated “high-impact jobs” list with filters; helpful for quickly learning role shapes and org landscape. Probably Good+1

## When to suggest
- Candidate wants concrete roles fast
- Candidate gets motivated by seeing real options

## When not to
- Candidate is easily overwhelmed by listings (do A first)
- Use the tiny scanning method (8–12 roles → label → circle 3 roles + 2 skill gaps → 1 direction + 1 next step).
