Clear, concrete "what are solutions categories?" explainer; good for candidates who need video intuition fast.

## When to suggest

- Candidate is early and needs an accessible entry point

## When not to
- Candidate is trying to optimize for EA-prioritized levers only (then keep to Probably Good / 80k and use Drawdown purely as intuition-building)
