Clear, concrete “what are solutions categories?” explainer; good for candidates who need video intuition fast. YouTube+1

## When to suggest
- Candidate prefers YouTube learning and wants a practical solutions map
- Candidate is early and needs an accessible entry point

## When not to
- Candidate is trying to optimize for EA-prioritized levers only (then keep to Probably Good / 80k and use Drawdown purely as intuition-building)
- Watch 1 episode that matches their curiosity and write 5 bullets: “what lever this is + what seems hard/neglected.”
