Big climate-specific job marketplace; good for breadth + pattern recognition on roles. Climatebase.org+1

## When to suggest
- Candidate wants a broad set of climate roles (tech/nonprofit/etc.)
- Candidate is exploring “where could I fit?”

## When not to
- Candidate wants more EA-filtered roles first (use 80k job board)
- Save 10 roles; label role-types and extract 2 recurring skill gaps.
