A guided way to explore climate sub-areas and see where your skills could fit. Work on Climate

## When to suggest
- Candidate wants “map the space” without committing to a long course
- Candidate is unsure which climate lane to test first

## When not to
- Candidate already has a specific lane and just needs next actions (use job board / volunteering / giving)
- Pick one Starter Pack and do the first 1–2 items.
