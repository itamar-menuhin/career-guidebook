Structured “map the space + find your role” container; good for people who want guided exploration. Terra

## When to suggest
- Candidate likes cohorts and structure
- Candidate has bandwidth for a medium commitment exploration phase

## When not to
- Candidate needs immediate action and tends to over-learn (use Work on Climate or job boards)
- Look at syllabus + next cohort timing and see if it fits their timeline.
