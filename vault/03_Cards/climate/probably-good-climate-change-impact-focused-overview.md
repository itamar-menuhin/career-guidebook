EA-ish overview that frames climate with an “impact-focused / what to do about it” lens. Probably Good+1

## When to suggest
- Candidate wants a broad, EA-style orientation to climate as a cause area
- Candidate is deciding whether climate is “their thing” at all

## When not to
- Candidate already knows they’re climate-committed and wants immediate action (jump to Work on Climate / job boards)
- Skim the overview and write 5 bullets: “which levers seem highest impact + which feel personally plausible.”
