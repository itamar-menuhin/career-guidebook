## When to suggest
- Candidate wants to make opportunities concrete or is motivated by real openings
- Candidate is ready to start seeing org landscape / role patterns

## When not to
- Candidate is very early and gets overwhelmed by job posts (use Experiment A first)

## Best next step (≤60 min)
Use the scan method: collect 8–12 roles → label role-types → circle 3 roles + 2 repeating skill gaps.
