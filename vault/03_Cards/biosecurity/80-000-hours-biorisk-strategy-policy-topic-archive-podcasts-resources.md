A curated list of deeper resources (often podcasts) for “field texture” and understanding real constraints/approaches. 80,000 Hours+1

## When to suggest
- Candidate liked Experiment A and wants more texture without committing to a course
- Candidate learns well via podcasts/interviews

## When not to
- Candidate tends to get lost in content consumption (use BlueDot or OBG instead)

## Best next step (≤60 min)
Pick one episode from the archive and listen to the first 20–30 minutes; note 3 “real-world bottlenecks” that stood out.
