A broader opportunities surface (programs, fellowships, events) that often includes biosecurity-specific entry ramps beyond “jobs.” Effective Altruism+1

## When to suggest
- Candidate is earlier-stage and wants programs/fellowships
- Candidate benefits from short structured opportunities rather than open-ended job search

## When not to
- Candidate gets overwhelmed by breadth (choose one concrete program card instead)

## Best next step (≤60 min)
Search “biosecurity” and save 3 opportunities that match your constraints/timeline.
