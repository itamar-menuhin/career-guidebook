## When to suggest
- Candidate is interested and wants structured exposure + peers
- Candidate doesn’t yet know which sub-area to focus on

## When not to
- Candidate has near-zero bandwidth right now (use Experiment A first)

## Best next step (≤60 min)
Open the course page, skim curriculum, and sanity-check timing vs bandwidth.
