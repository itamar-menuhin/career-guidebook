A short, structured intro from DeepMind; good for people who prefer a “course vibe” over an explainer video.

## When to suggest
- Candidate likes structured learning and wants an intro under ~1 hour
- Candidate is skeptical and prefers institutional framing

## When not to
- Candidate wants the EA community’s strategy framing (use 80k reading alt instead)

## Best next step (≤60 min)
Watch the first chunk and note: “which track feels more like me: technical vs governance/policy?”
