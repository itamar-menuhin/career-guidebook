An 8-week reading-group-style on-ramp used widely in the community: concepts, discussion, and a project component.

## When to suggest
- Candidate is interested and wants deeper understanding + community discussion
- Candidate benefits from external structure/accountability

## When not to
- Candidate has no bandwidth for weekly participation (use Experiment A instead)

## Best next step (≤60 min)
Read the curriculum/application page and see if week 1–2 feels exciting (not intimidating).
