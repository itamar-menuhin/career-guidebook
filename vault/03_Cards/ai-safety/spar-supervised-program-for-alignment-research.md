Part-time, remote, mentored projects designed to produce work that contributes to AI alignment/safety—good “measurable-good” project pathway.

## When to suggest
- Candidate wants to do something real (not just learn)
- Candidate benefits from mentorship + defined projects
- Candidate needs a push past impostor syndrome / “I’m not ready”

## When not to
- Candidate can’t realistically commit to the time window, even part-time

## Best next step (≤60 min)
Browse the current/most recent projects; shortlist 2–3 you’d genuinely apply to and write 2 lines each (interest + feasibility).
