Broader than jobs: fellowships, programs, events, volunteering—useful to find “entry ramps.”

## When to suggest
- Candidate is earlier-stage and wants programs/projects not only jobs
- Candidate is exploring multiple cause areas and wants a single “opportunities surface”

## When not to
- Candidate gets overwhelmed by breadth (use one concrete program card instead)

## Best next step (≤60 min)
Search “AI safety” and save 3 opportunities that match your constraints/bandwidth.
