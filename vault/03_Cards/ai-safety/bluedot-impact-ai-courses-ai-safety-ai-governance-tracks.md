Cohort-based courses that help people understand the field and meet peers; good default “structured exposure.”

## When to suggest
- Candidate wants structured learning + peers; not ready for a research fellowship yet
- Candidate leans governance/policy OR wants a “less technical” entry option

## When not to
- Candidate is explicitly seeking a mentored project output now (use SPAR)

## Best next step (≤60 min)
Pick one track (technical safety vs governance) and check cohort timing vs bandwidth.
