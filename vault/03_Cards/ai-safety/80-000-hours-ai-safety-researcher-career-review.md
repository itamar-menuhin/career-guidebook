A canonical EA-style “should I do this?” overview, with concrete role shapes and realities.

## When to suggest
- Candidate prefers reading
- Candidate wants reality-checks on what the work looks like

## When not to
- Candidate is only looking for a quick interest test (use Robert Miles instead)

## Best next step (≤60 min)
Skim sections: “what the work involves” + “who is a good fit” + write 3 bullets: “what matches me / what doesn’t.”
