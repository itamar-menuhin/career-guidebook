A high-signal job board with many EA-aligned roles; good for building intuition and spotting real orgs/roles.

## When to suggest
- Candidate is ready to make roles concrete or is motivated by seeing real openings
- Candidate wants a practical bridge from interest → action

## When not to
- Candidate is very early and gets overwhelmed by job posts (use Experiment A first)

## Best next step (≤60 min)
Do the 10–25 min scan: collect 8–12 roles → label role-types → circle 3 roles + 2 repeating skill gaps.
