title: Biosecurity
summary: Biosecurity / Pandemic preparedness quick-start (v1)
role_shapes:
- Public health security / policy / strategy
- Technical work (biosurveillance, diagnostics, PPE/engineering controls, forecasting)
- Research & analysis (risk assessment, program evaluation, modeling)
- Ops/programs (running initiatives, coordination, funding ops)
- AI-bio risk work (when relevant) 80,000 Hours
- What a good fit often looks like (signals)
- Motivated by preparedness + systems thinking (institutions, incentives, coordination)
- Comfortable with policy/bureaucracy and/or technical public health work
- Often benefits from “make it concrete” steps (projects, job-board scan), because
  the space can feel abstract
- Experiments (canonical picks + optional alt)
- Experiment A — 1-hour overview (choose 1)
- 80,000 Hours Biorisk research, strategy & policy career review (read/skim as an
  overview entry point). 80,000 Hours
- 'YouTube talk (EA-context): Jaime Yassif (biosecurity / GCBRs) talk (good “field
  picture” overview). YouTube'
- Experiment B — longer exposure (choose 1)
- BlueDot Impact — Biosecurity course (structured ~30h exposure). BlueDot+1
- 'Optional alt: pick 1–2 episodes/articles from 80,000 Hours’ biosecurity materials
  for deeper texture (e.g., health security interviews, misconceptions series). 80,000
  Hours+280,000 Hours+2'
- Experiment C — project pathway (make it concrete)
- 'Canonical pick: Oxford Biosecurity Group (OBG) projects (part-time remote research
  projects; biosecurity + AI-bio intersection). My Site+1'
- 'Toe-in-the-water step: browse the projects page; pick 2 projects that seem feasible/interesting;
  write 2 lines each.'
- Experiment D — job-board exploration (choose 1–2)
- 80,000 Hours job board (filter toward biosecurity/pandemic preparedness roles).
  80,000 Hours Job Board+1
- 'Optional alt: EA Opportunities for events/fellowships/short programs in biosecurity.
  Effective Altruism'
- 'Tiny scanning method (10–25 min): same as AI safety (8–12 roles → label → circle
  3 roles + 2 skill gaps).'

## Biosecurity / Pandemic preparedness quick-start (v1)

## What it’s trying to achieve (plain language)

Reduce catastrophic biological risks (natural outbreaks and engineered pathogens) by improving prevention, detection, response, and policy—so society is far less vulnerable to extreme pandemics. 80,000 Hours+1
