title: "Biosecurity / Pandemic preparedness"
summary: "Reduce catastrophic biological risks (natural outbreaks and engineered pathogens) by improving prevention, detection, response, and policy—so society is far less vulnerable to extreme pandemics."
role_shapes:
- "Public health security / policy / strategy"
- "Technical work (biosurveillance, diagnostics, PPE/engineering controls, forecasting)"
- "Research & analysis (risk assessment, program evaluation, modeling)"
- "Ops/programs (running initiatives, coordination, funding ops)"
- "AI-bio risk work (when relevant)"
fit_signals:
- "Motivated by preparedness + systems thinking (institutions, incentives, coordination)"
- "Comfortable with policy/bureaucracy and/or technical public health work"
- "Often benefits from 'make it concrete' steps (projects, job-board scan), because the space can feel abstract"
common_confusions:
- "Add common confusion here..."
