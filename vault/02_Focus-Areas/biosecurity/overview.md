title: Biosecurity
summary: Biosecurity / Pandemic preparedness quick-start (v1)
role_shapes:
- Public health security / policy / strategy
- Technical work (biosurveillance, diagnostics, PPE/engineering controls, forecasting)
- Research & analysis (risk assessment, program evaluation, modeling)

- AI-bio risk work (when relevant) 80,000 Hours
- What a good fit often looks like (signals)
- Motivated by preparedness + systems thinking (institutions, incentives, coordination)
- Comfortable with policy/bureaucracy and/or technical public health work
- Often benefits from “make it concrete” steps (projects, job-board scan), because
  the space can feel abstract
- Experiments (canonical picks + optional alt)

- 80,000 Hours Biorisk research, strategy & policy career review (read/skim as an
  overview entry point). 80,000 Hours
- 'YouTube talk (EA-context): Jaime Yassif (biosecurity / GCBRs) talk (good “field
  picture” overview). YouTube'
- Experiment B — longer exposure (choose 1)
- BlueDot Impact — Biosecurity course (structured ~30h exposure). BlueDot+1
- 'Optional alt: pick 1–2 episodes/articles from 80,000 Hours’ biosecurity materials
  for deeper texture (e.g., health security interviews, misconceptions series). 80,000
  Hours+280,000 Hours+2'
- Experiment C — project pathway (make it concrete)
- 'Canonical pick: Oxford Biosecurity Group (OBG) projects (part-time remote research
  projects; biosecurity + AI-bio intersection). My Site+1'
- 'Toe-in-the-water step: browse the projects page; pick 2 projects that seem feasible/interesting;
  write 2 lines each.'
- Experiment D — job-board exploration (choose 1–2)

  80,000 Hours Job Board+1
- 'Optional alt: EA Opportunities for events/fellowships/short programs in biosecurity.
  Effective Altruism'
- 'Tiny scanning method (10–25 min): same as AI safety (8–12 roles → label → circle
  3 roles + 2 skill gaps).'
