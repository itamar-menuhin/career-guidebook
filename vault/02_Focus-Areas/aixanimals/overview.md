title: Animal × AI quick-start (v1)
summary: 1) What it’s trying to achieve (plain language)
role_shapes:
- 'Applied ML for wild animal welfare: human–wildlife conflict mitigation, monitoring
  welfare indicators (e.g., vocalizations), detection/early warning systems. (Rethink
  Priorities)'
- 'AI in farmed animal systems: how AI in agriculture/aquaculture changes welfare
  (sometimes better, sometimes worse), plus interventions to steer it. (Rethink Priorities)'
- 'AI for animal advocacy orgs: LLM-enabled research workflows, message testing, supporter
  comms, grantwriting support, ops automation (done carefully). (Faunalytics)'
- Research & strategy at think tanks (what AI applications are promising, where are
  risks/unknowns). (Rethink Priorities)
- Programs / community / hackathons for building tools and pipelines for animal protection.
  (Electric Sheep)
- 3) What a “good fit” often looks like (signals)
- You like concrete technical leverage (data/ML) and you’re motivated by animals.
- You’re comfortable with “applied + messy” domains (datasets, field conditions, imperfect
  metrics).
- 'You can hold a balanced stance: “AI can help” and “AI can harm if used carelessly.”
  (Animal Charity Evaluators)'
- 4) Experiments (canonical picks + optional alt)
- Experiment A — 1-hour overview (choose 1)
- Canonical picks
- Animal Charity Evaluators — “The impacts of AI on animal advocacy” (high-level framing
  of upsides/risks; good first map). (Animal Charity Evaluators)
- Rethink Priorities — AI for human–wildlife conflict mitigations (concrete examples;
  “here’s what AI-for-animals can look like”). (Rethink Priorities)
- Optional alt (if they want “how advocates already use AI”)
- Faunalytics — “AI and Animal Advocacy” (survey-style view of current usage patterns).
  (Faunalytics)
- Experiment B — longer exposure (choose 1)
- Canonical pick (evidence/field grounding)
- 'Rethink Priorities series: “How AI is affecting farmed aquatic animals” (deep dive
  on innovation → deployment → welfare effects; very “EA research-y”). (Rethink Priorities)'
- Optional alt (structured program)
- AI×Animals Fellowship (8-week remote program focused on AI × animal welfare careers).
  (Effective Altruism)
- Futurekind AI Fellowship (12-week program on using AI for animal protection & environment;
  listed on EA Opportunities). (Effective Altruism)
- (These structured programs are newer; I’m including them because they’re explicitly
  advertised in EA channels, but they’re not as long-established as core 80k/AAC resources.)
  (Effective Altruism)
- Experiment C — project pathway (make it concrete; good for “I need a push”)
- Canonical pick (low barrier, EA-aligned research contribution)
- 'Use a Rethink Priorities “AI for animals” angle to produce a small artifact:'
- 1–2 page scoping note (“which AI application + what welfare mechanism + what uncertainties?”)
- or a lightweight literature/landscape map that could be shared with an org/funder.
  (Rethink Priorities)
- Canonical pick (concrete + clearly external)
- Felidae Fund — volunteer AI/ML specialist processing camera imagery for animal population
  research (explicit volunteer role with real use). Felidae Conservation Fund+1
- Optional alt
- Faunalytics volunteering (if the person’s contribution is in the “research tooling
  / analysis” lane that directly supports advocates). Faunalytics
- Toe-in-the-water next step (≤60 min)
- Pick one subdomain (e.g., “wildlife conflict detection,” “aquaculture AI welfare
  risks,” “LLM research tooling for advocates”).
- 'Find one anchor piece (from Experiment A/B), then write 10 bullets: “promising
  application → mechanism → biggest risk/unknown → what a small project could be.”'
- Experiment D — job-board exploration (bridge theory → action)
- Canonical picks (choose 1–2)
- 80,000 Hours job board (filter for animal welfare, or AI/data roles in adjacent
  orgs).
- Animal Advocacy Careers job board (search for data/tech roles; also helps you learn
  org landscape). (Animal Advocacy Careers)
- Optional alt
- EA Opportunities (often has fellowships/programs/projects that aren’t “jobs”). (Effective
  Altruism)
- Tiny scanning method (10–25 min)
- Collect 8–12 roles → label role type (ML / research / ops / policy) → circle 3 roles
  + 2 repeating skill gaps → turn that into a direction + next step.
- Program implementation & field ops (distribution, logistics, monitoring)
- Research & evaluation (development econ, epidemiology, cost-effectiveness, RCTs)
- Grantmaking / philanthropy (moving money well; vetting)
- Policy and government implementation (health systems, procurement, public finance)
- Entrepreneurship / founding new orgs (esp. “evidence-to-scale” nonprofits) (80,000
  Hours)
- 3) What a “good fit” often looks like (signals)
- You’re motivated by measurable impact and are OK with “unsexy” operational realities
  (supply chains, compliance, systems)
- You like working with messy real-world constraints and still making steady progress
- You enjoy evidence and tradeoffs (not only “what’s morally urgent” but also “what
  works”) (80,000 Hours)
- 'A useful “menu” (not a checklist):'
- Policy / government / regulation (often very leveraged; hard to attribute impact,
  but can be huge). Probably Good+1
- Climate-focused engineering / tech (clean power, industrial decarbonization, storage,
  etc.). Probably Good+1
- Research (climate science, modelling, carbon removal R&D, or “what actually works”
  analysis). 80,000 Hours+1
- Advocacy / communications (especially around “neglected-but-effective” interventions).
  80,000 Hours+1
- Climate finance / impact investing (moving large sums can matter; also easy to do
  “busy work,” so select carefully). Probably Good+1
- Community / field-building (helping others enter or coordinate effectively). Work
  on Climate+1

fit_signals:
- You’re willing to be a bit strategic (choosing which slice of climate to push on,
  not just “anything climate”). Probably Good+1
- You can tolerate imperfect feedback loops (policy + systems change can be slow and
  hard to measure). Probably Good+1
- 'You like high-leverage work: “one decision / one institution → very large downstream
  effects.”'

## What it’s trying to achieve (plain language)

Use AI to reduce animal suffering (farmed and wild) by improving how we measure welfare, prevent harms, target advocacy, and design interventions — while also being careful about ways AI deployment can accidentally increase suffering (e.g., scale effects, mismeasurement, perverse incentives). (Animal Charity Evaluators)
