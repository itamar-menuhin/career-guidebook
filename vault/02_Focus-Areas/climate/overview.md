title: Climate quick-start (v1)
summary: 1) What it’s trying to achieve (plain language)
role_shapes:
- 'A useful “menu” (not a checklist):'
- Policy / government / regulation (often very leveraged; hard to attribute impact,
  but can be huge). Probably Good+1
- Climate-focused engineering / tech (clean power, industrial decarbonization, storage,
  etc.). Probably Good+1
- Research (climate science, modelling, carbon removal R&D, or “what actually works”
  analysis). 80,000 Hours+1
- Advocacy / communications (especially around “neglected-but-effective” interventions).
  80,000 Hours+1
- Climate finance / impact investing (moving large sums can matter; also easy to do
  “busy work,” so select carefully). Probably Good+1
- Community / field-building (helping others enter or coordinate effectively). Work
  on Climate+1
- 'When to suggest (trigger criteria):'
- Candidate wants concrete roles fast
- Candidate gets motivated by seeing real options
- 'When not to (contraindications):'
- Candidate is easily overwhelmed by listings (do A first)
- 'Toe in the water step (≤60 min):'
- Use the tiny scanning method (8–12 roles → label → circle 3 roles + 2 skill gaps
  → 1 direction + 1 next step).

- 'When to suggest (trigger criteria):'
- Candidate wants a broad set of climate roles (tech/nonprofit/etc.)
- Candidate is exploring “where could I fit?”
- 'When not to (contraindications):'
- Candidate wants more EA-filtered roles first (use 80k job board)
- 'Toe in the water step (≤60 min):'
- Save 10 roles; label role-types and extract 2 recurring skill gaps.

- Scan 8–12 roles → label → circle 3 roles + 2 repeating skill gaps → convert to 1
  direction + 1 next step.

fit_signals:
- You’re willing to be a bit strategic (choosing which slice of climate to push on,
  not just “anything climate”). Probably Good+1
- You can tolerate imperfect feedback loops (policy + systems change can be slow and
  hard to measure). Probably Good+1
- 'You like high-leverage work: “one decision / one institution → very large downstream
  effects.”'

## What it’s trying to achieve (plain language)

Rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions (and support adaptation where it’s most valuable) by pushing on the highest-leverage bottlenecks: policy, clean energy deployment, targeted innovation, and (in some cases) carbon removal. Both 80,000 Hours and Probably Good emphasize that career choice tends to matter more than personal footprint, and that some climate actions are much more effective than others. 80,000 Hours+1
