title: Climate
summary: "Rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions (and support adaptation where it's most valuable) by pushing on the highest-leverage bottlenecks: policy, clean energy deployment, targeted innovation, and (in some cases) carbon removal."
role_shapes:
- "**Policy / government / regulation:** (often very leveraged; hard to attribute impact, but can be huge)."
- "**Climate-focused engineering / tech:** (clean power, industrial decarbonization, storage, etc.)."
- "**Research:** (climate science, modelling, carbon removal R&D, or 'what actually works' analysis)."
- "**Advocacy / communications:** (especially around 'neglected-but-effective' interventions)."
- "**Climate finance / impact investing:** (moving large sums can matter; also easy to do 'busy work,' so select carefully)."
- "**Community / field-building:** (helping others enter or coordinate effectively)."
fit_signals:
- "You're willing to be a bit strategic (choosing which slice of climate to push on, not just 'anything climate')."
- "You can tolerate imperfect feedback loops (policy + systems change can be slow and hard to measure)."
- "You like high-leverage work: 'one decision / one institution -> very large downstream effects.'"
common_confusions:
- "Add common confusion here..."
