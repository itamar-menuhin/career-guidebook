## Hands-on project — proof of fit
- **Distill a Paper:** Read one seminal paper (e.g. *Constitutional AI* or *RLHF*) and write a 1-page plain-English summary.
- **The "Jailbreak" Test:** Use a red-teaming interface (like *Gandalf* or similar) to try and bypass safety guardrails. Understand *how* they fail.
- **Fellowship / Menorship:** Apply to **SPAR** (part-time, remote) to work on a specific research project with a mentor.
