title: "Animal x AI"
summary: "Use AI to reduce animal suffering (farmed and wild) by improving how we measure welfare, prevent harms, target advocacy, and design interventions — while also being careful about ways AI deployment can accidentally increase suffering (e.g., scale effects, mismeasurement, perverse incentives)."
role_shapes:
- "Applied ML for wild animal welfare: human–wildlife conflict mitigation, monitoring welfare indicators (e.g., vocalizations), detection/early warning systems."
- "AI in farmed animal systems: how AI in agriculture/aquaculture changes welfare (sometimes better, sometimes worse), plus interventions to steer it."
- "AI for animal advocacy orgs: LLM-enabled research workflows, message testing, supporter comms, grantwriting support, ops automation (done carefully)."
- "Research & strategy at think tanks (what AI applications are promising, where are risks/unknowns)."
- "Programs / community / hackathons for building tools and pipelines for animal protection."
fit_signals:
- "You like concrete technical leverage (data/ML) and you're motivated by animals."
- "You're comfortable with 'applied + messy' domains (datasets, field conditions, imperfect metrics)."
- "You can hold a balanced stance: 'AI can help' and 'AI can harm if used carelessly.'"
