title: Global Health & Development quick-start (v1)
summary: 1) What it’s trying to achieve (plain language)
role_shapes:
- Program implementation & field ops (distribution, logistics, monitoring)
- Research & evaluation (development econ, epidemiology, cost-effectiveness, RCTs)
- Grantmaking / philanthropy (moving money well; vetting)
- Policy and government implementation (health systems, procurement, public finance)
- Entrepreneurship / founding new orgs (esp. “evidence-to-scale” nonprofits) (80,000
  Hours)
- 3) What a “good fit” often looks like (signals)
- You’re motivated by measurable impact and are OK with “unsexy” operational realities
  (supply chains, compliance, systems)
- You like working with messy real-world constraints and still making steady progress
- You enjoy evidence and tradeoffs (not only “what’s morally urgent” but also “what
  works”) (80,000 Hours)
- 4) Experiments (A–D)
- 'Experiment A — introductory resource (< 1 hour): wide overview + test interest'
- 'Choose 1:'
- '80,000 Hours problem profile: Health in poor countries (Global health) (read/skim)
  (80,000 Hours)'
- 'YouTube: GiveWell finds highly cost-effective charities — here’s how (good for
  the “why evidence?” mindset) (YouTube)'
- 'Optional alt (more “why give effectively” than GH-specific): Peter Singer TED talk
  (via The Life You Can Save) (The Life You Can Save)'
- Entrepreneurship orientation video (<1h)
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKmKLcYoixs
- 'Experiment B — longer exposure: understand the field with more granularity'
- 'Choose 1:'
- '(Non-EA but solid grounding) Coursera: An Introduction to Global Health (structured
  modules; builds vocabulary + systems map) (Coursera)'
- 'Crash Course playlist: Public Health (lighter but sticky; good for people who prefer
  video series) (YouTube)'
- Experiment C — pathway to doing a project (for proof-of-fit + momentum)
- 'Best for: people who need action to stay motivated, want quick proof-of-fit, or
  need a push past impostor syndrome.'
- Here “measurable good” is often easiest via moving money effectively or creating
  a real-world mobilization, since many top orgs don’t offer easy small volunteer
  tasks.
- Canonical pick
- Run a small fundraising/donation drive for GiveWell Top Charities / Top Charities
  Fund
- 'Measurable outcome: $ donated (or matched) + number of donors. GiveWell explicitly
  routes donations to its recommended opportunities. GiveWell+2GiveWell+2'
- Optional alt
- 'GWWC Pledge Drive as a community action experiment (measurable: pledges taken +
  giving committed). Giving What We Can+1'
- Experiment D — explore specific job boards (intuition + bridge to action)
- 'Pick 1–2:'
- 80,000 Hours job board (good EA filter for high-impact roles) (80,000 Hours)
- ReliefWeb jobs (humanitarian + development roles; good breadth) (ReliefWeb)
- Devex job search (global development-focused job board) (Devex)
- Impactpool (UN + international orgs; public health roles) (Impactpool)
- 'Tiny scanning method (10–25 min): collect 8–12 roles → label role-types → circle
  3 roles + 2 repeating skill gaps → turn into one “direction to test” + one next
  step.'

## What it’s trying to achieve (plain language)

Reduce large-scale suffering and premature death by scaling interventions that are cheap, evidence-backed, and logistically feasible (e.g., malaria prevention/treatment, vaccinations, nutrition). (80,000 Hours)
