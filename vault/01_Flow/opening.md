1) What “good” looks like (outcomes)

By the end of the session, the person leaves with:

Clarity on 2–4 plausible directions (not 1)

Energy (felt sense: “this is doable”)

Concrete next steps: 1–2 low-cost experiments per direction

A written summary + links + intros/contacts as relevant

2) Core stance (tone + approach)

“Mutual think tank,” not “advisor with answers”

You’re building career hypotheses and testing plans, not making a forever decision.

You’re allowed to say “I’m not sure” and pivot to: who to ask / what to test / what to read next.

3) Standard operating flow (60–90 minutes)

Prework (optional, 5–10 min)
Short intake form to save time and reduce blank-page stress.

Call flow (typical timing)

Opening & goal for today (5 min)

What you bring (15–20 min)

What you want / what feels satisfying (5–10 min)

Constraints + degrees of freedom (5–10 min)
→ Steps 1–4 together are usually ~30 minutes.

Iterative direction testing (25–45 min)
Back-and-forth between proposing directions and narrowing in real time:

propose a direction (or they propose)

test fit quickly (strengths, motivation, constraints)

immediately find 1 low-cost “first small step (≤60 min)” step

read reaction (enthusiasm / resistance / confusion)

adjust / pivot / narrow

“lock in” 2–4 promising directions as you go

as you lock in each direction, you also lock in 1–2 next steps

Wrap + written summary (5–10 min)

recap the directions + next steps you locked in

write it down together (live notes, or you type while summarizing)

make sure the next steps feel clear, low-pressure, and doable

follow-up plan (optional)

After-call (optional)
If anything wasn’t written during the wrap: send the summary + links/resources + intros.
