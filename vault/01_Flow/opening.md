## What you bring (15–20 min)

## What you want / what feels satisfying (5–10 min)

Constraints + degrees of freedom (5–10 min)
→ Steps 1–4 together are usually ~30 minutes.

Iterative direction testing (25–45 min)
Back-and-forth between proposing directions and narrowing in real time:

## propose a direction (or they propose)

## test fit quickly (strengths, motivation, constraints)

## immediately find 1 low-cost “toe in the water” step

## read reaction (enthusiasm / resistance / confusion)

## adjust / pivot / narrow

## “lock in” 2–4 promising directions as you go

as you lock in each direction, you also lock in 1–2 next steps

## Wrap + written summary (5–10 min)

## recap the directions + next steps you locked in

write it down together (live notes, or you type while summarizing)

make sure the next steps feel clear, low-pressure, and doable

## follow-up plan (optional)

After-call (optional)
If anything wasn’t written during the wrap: send the summary + links/resources + intros.
