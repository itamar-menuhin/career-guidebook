## During the wrap (live)

“Let me summarize what we have so far — stop me if I misrepresent anything.”

Write it down together (you type while you talk).

## Written summary (shared live or sent after)

## Snapshot

Current situation:

What you’re aiming for (near-term):

Must-haves (what good work needs to include):

Constraints (timeline/bandwidth/location/financial stability):

Promising directions (2–4)
For each direction:

Direction (1 sentence):

Why it might fit (1–2 bullets):

Next steps (1–2 low-cost steps):

## Resources / links to support the next steps

Go through the next steps and list any relevant links/resources you should send (no fixed limit).

Rule of thumb: links exist to make next steps easier, not as extra reading.

## People to talk to / intros (if any)

## Door open

“If questions come up after you digest this, feel free to message.”

## Optional: “If it would help, we can do a check-in later.”

## Cause-area quick-start page template (locked)

Cause area name:
What this area is trying to achieve (2–4 lines, plain language)
What kinds of work exist here (role shapes, not org names)
What a “good fit” often looks like (signals, not requirements)
Experiments (pick the ones that fit the person)
Experiment A — 1-hour overview: broad overview + interest test; canonical intro resource/video 
Experiment B — longer exposure: course/fellowship/series; field granularity
Experiment C — project pathway: hands-on; proof-of-fit; motivation-from-action; also good for people needing a push / impostor syndrome.
Experiment C should have an external beneficiary + a concrete deliverable + a measurable outcome
Experiment D — job-board exploration: make roles/orgs concrete + bridge theory→action (boards + quick scan method)
Recommendation cards 
Well-known organizations in the field (divide into organization types; for each org add a tag: EA-canonical / EA-adjacent / Field institution; include raw URLs)
Copy-paste links (raw URLs)
