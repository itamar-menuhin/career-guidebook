Instructor-only purpose: map what’s realistic right now (and what might be realistic later) so ideas match their life situation.

Candidate-facing one-liner (optional):
“Quick logistics map so we aim at options that actually fit your life.”

Prompts with gentle option scaffolding

What kind of change is on the table right now (staying put / switching org same lane / shifting function / bigger field change)?

Location-wise, what’s realistic (only local / remote-only / hybrid / short trips / temporary relocation for a program / full relocation)?

What bandwidth do you have (a couple hours a week / serious push for a month / basically none right now)?

What’s your timeline (need something soon / exploring while employed for 6–12 months / planning bigger change after a milestone)?

Do you need the next step to be very stable, or is there some room for uncertainty?

What level of ambiguity feels okay vs draining?

How do you feel about starting something (project/org/startup)—from “nope” to “maybe later” to “exciting”?

Impact pathway: work itself on-mission vs donations/volunteering vs unsure.
