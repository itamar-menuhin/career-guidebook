## The loop (how directions get tested and narrowed)
### For each direction that comes up (yours or theirs):
- Name it simply (one sentence)
- Test fit quickly (strengths, must-haves, constraints/timeline)
- Find a toe-in-the-water step immediately (ideally ≤60 minutes)
- Read reaction (spark / neutral / no)
- Adjust / pivot / park it
- If it’s promising, keep it; if not, drop it without drama
- By the end you usually have 2–4 promising directions, each with 1–2 small next steps already identified during testing.
