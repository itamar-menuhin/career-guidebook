## Session Outcomes

- **Directional Clarity**: Identify 2–4 plausible directions. Focus on exploring options, not finding "the one" answer yet.
- **Renewed Energy**: They leave feeling capable and excited ("this is doable").
- **Concrete Experiments**: Define 1–2 low-cost experiments **per direction** to test the waters, verify fit, or resolve key uncertainties.
- **Actionable Support**: A written summary, plus specific links or warm introductions **if meaningful**.

## Facilitator Stance

- **Think Partner, Not Guru**: You don't need all the answers. Your role is to help them think better, not to tell them what to do.
- **Scout Mindset**: Explore the terrain together. Build hypotheses and look for evidence, rather than defending a position.
- **Embrace Uncertainty**: It's okay to say "I don't know." Pivot the conversation to: *How could we find out?*

## Standard operating flow (60–90 minutes)

### Before the meeting

**Context Gathering**: Ask open-ended questions like "What helps me prepare?" or "What is on your mind?" to allow them to set the agenda without rigid homework.

### During the meeting

#### Understanding the candidate (~30 minutes)

##### Opening & Alignment

**Goal**: Establish rapport and understand their current reality.

**Prompts**:
- "What’s been on your mind regarding your career lately?"
- "What would make this conversation a success for you?"
- "Where should we focus our energy today?"

**Facilitator notes**:
- **Listen for Signal**: Use their opening answer to calibrate—do they need space to vent, or are they ready to problem-solve?
- **It's Okay to Be Vague**: If they don't have a clear goal yet, that's normal. Discovering the goal *is* the goal of the session.
- **Check the Clock**: Aim for ~5 minutes here so you have ample time for the deep dive.

##### Current Trajectory

**Goal**: Understand their "default path"—where they have been, what they are building, and where they are going *if we do nothing today*.

**Prompts (Grouped)**:

**The Context**
- "What’s your current role + what do you actually do week to week?"

**The Assets**
- "What have you done that you’re proud of (even small)?"
- "What do people consistently come to you for?"
- "If I watched you work for a day, what would I see you doing well?"
- "Which skills do you want to use vs build this year?"

**The Plan**
- "What’s your current plan right now? (even if it’s fuzzy)"
- "What are the next steps you’re already taking — applications, courses, conversations?"

**Mini-exercise (2–3 min): Asset Audit (Goal = 8 items)**
List 8 items total, with at least 2 in each category:
- **Hard Skills**: (e.g. coding, writing, synthesis)
- **Soft Skills**: (e.g. facilitation, empathy, grit)
- **Uncommon Assets**: (e.g. deep knowledge of a niche, a specific network)
- (The remaining 2 can go anywhere)

**Facilitator notes**:
- **Evidence over Claims**: Don't just take their word for it; ask for concrete examples ("When did you use that?").
- **Capture Transferable Strengths**: Look for skills that apply across domains, not just what is valid in their current role.

##### The Intrinsic Field

**Goal**: Map the separate components of what works for them (drivers, causes, styles). The aim is to reveal the full "playing field" and find clues for options they haven't considered, not to force a single 3-year plan.

**Prompts (Grouped)**:

**Satisfaction Clues**
- "Can you give me examples of times you felt engaged, satisfied, or proud? What exactly was satisfying about that?" (Isolating the driver)
- "Do you need a strong technical challenge to feel fulfilled?"
- "Do you need the work itself to be the impact, or can it just fund the impact?"

**The Pull (Problem Areas)**
- "Are there causes you feel pulled toward reading about or solving?"
- "What kinds of contribution feel meaningful? (Research, organizing, building?)"

**Operating Parameters**
- "People vs Alone: what balance makes you thrive?"
- "Stability vs Intensity: what is your sustainable pace?"
- "What reliably drains you?"

**Summarize**:
- **Satisfaction Drivers**: What specific activities make them feel "in the zone".
- **Problem Attributes**: Which causes or types of impact they are naturally pulled to.
- **Operating Parameters**: The essential constraints (pace, people, autonomy) for them to thrive.

##### Reality Check

**Goal**: Defined the "Boundary Conditions" for the next step.

**Prompts (Grouped)**:

**The Logistics**
- "Location: What’s realistic? (Local only, remote, hybrid, temporary relocation, full relocation? Any specific constraints on where?)"
- "Bandwidth: What can you give? (A few hours/week, a dedicated sprint, or full-time focus?)"
- "Timeline: What’s the horizon? (Need something soon vs exploring for 6–12 months?)"

**The Scope of Change**
- "Change Appetite: How big a change is on the table? (Staying put, switching orgs, shifting function, or total field change?)"
- "Impact Pathway: Do you need the work itself to be on-mission, or are donation/volunteering paths on the table?"

**The Risk Profile**
- "Uncertainty: Do you need stability right now, or is this a time for high-variance bets?"
- "Ambiguity: What level of ambiguity feels exciting vs draining?"
- "Founder Appetite: How do you feel about starting something? (From 'nope' to 'maybe later' to 'exciting')"

#### The Hypothesis Loop (~30 minutes)

**Goal**: Surface 2–4 promising directions and identify a concrete, low-cost experiment for each.

**1. Prioritize Candidate Ideas**
- *Why:* Internal motivation is the strongest fuel.
- *The Stance:* Ride with it. If they have a lead, optimize it ("How could we make this even more impactful?"). A flawed idea they own is often better than a perfect idea they ignore.

**2. Pitching New Ideas (Connect the Dots)**
- *The Stance:* Offer options based on the "Assets" and "Intrinsic Field" you mapped earlier.
- *The Pitch:* "Given your [Specific Strength X], have you considered [Option Y]?"

**3. Read the Reaction (The Learning)**
- *Spark:* Great, move to testing.
- *Resistance:* **Curiosity, not convincing.** Don't push; probe.
    - *Misunderstanding?* "What does that role look like in your head?" (Correct the map).
    - *Fixable Element?* "I like the impact but hate the location." (Can we tweak parameters?).
    - *Deep Preference?* "I hate the idea of fundraising." (Crucial signal! Use this to adjust future ideas).

**4. The Experiment Framework (Select the right depth)**
- Don't test the career; test the hypothesis. Start with the lowest friction step that gives valid signal.
    - **Quick Taste (<1 hour)**: Read an article, watch a talk, listen to a podcast. (Test: Is the topic interesting?)
    - **Deeper Dive**: Take a short course, apply for a fellowship, speak to a practitioner. (Test: Do I want to go deeper?)
    - **Hands On**: Join a project, volunteer, run a small trial. (Test: Do I enjoy the actual work/impact?)
    - **Job Board Scan**: Look at actual job descriptions. (Test: Does the reality match the fantasy?)

**Outcome**:
- By the end, you usually have **2–4 promising directions**, each with **1–2 small next steps** already identified during testing.

#### The Wrap (Closing the Loop)

**Goal**: Leave no ambiguity. They should see their own thoughts organized and actionable.

**1. The Readback (Candidate Writes)**
- *The Move:* "To make sure we captured everything, can you open a doc and type out the summary while saying it aloud? I'll catch anything we miss."
- *Why:* When *they* write it, they own it. Speaking aloud allows you to course-correct ("Oh, don't forget the intro to Sarah").

**2. The Artifact (The Written Summary)**
- **The Snapshot**: One paragraph on their current edge & intrinsic drivers.
- **The Plan**: 2–4 Directions. For each, list:
    - *The Hypothesis:* Why this path?
    - *The Tests:* 2–3 concrete steps (e.g. read X, talk to Y, draft Z).

**3. Clear Follow-ups**
- **Your Homework**: Explicitly state what *you* owe them (Links to specific resources, Intros to specific people).
- **The Next Loop**: Set a trigger. "Should we put a 15-min check-in on the calendar for 6 weeks from now?"
