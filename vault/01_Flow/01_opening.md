## 1) What “good” looks like (outcomes)
**By the end of the session, the person leaves with:**
- Clarity on 3–6 plausible directions (not 1)
- A bias for action (testing, not just thinking)

## The Stance
**"We are scientists, not judges."**

You are not here to tell them what to do. You are here to design experiments.
- If they say "I want to start a nonprofit," you don't say "That sounds hard."
- You say: "Great hypothesis. What's the cheapest way we can test if you'd actually enjoy the day-to-day of a founder?"

## The "Win" Condition
The session is a success if they:
1. Feel **heard** (Validation).
2. Have **3–6 promising directions** (Options).
3. Have **concrete next steps** for each (Momentum).
## 3) Standard operating flow (60–90 minutes)
Prework (optional, 5–10 min)
Short intake form to save time and reduce blank-page stress.
Call flow (typical timing)
Opening & goal for today (5 min)
What you bring (15–20 min)
What you want / what feels satisfying (5–10 min)
Constraints + degrees of freedom (5–10 min)
→ Steps 1–4 together are usually ~30 minutes.
Iterative direction testing (25–45 min)
**Back-and-forth between proposing directions and narrowing in real time:**
- propose a direction (or they propose)
- test fit quickly (strengths, motivation, constraints)
- immediately find 1 low-cost “toe in the water” step
- read reaction (enthusiasm / resistance / confusion)
- adjust / pivot / narrow
- “lock in” 2–4 promising directions as you go
- as you lock in each direction, you also lock in 1–2 next steps
- Wrap + written summary (5–10 min)
- recap the directions + next steps you locked in
- write it down together (live notes, or you type while summarizing)
- make sure the next steps feel clear, low-pressure, and doable
- follow-up plan (optional)
- After-call (optional)
- If anything wasn’t written during the wrap: send the summary + links/resources + intros.
