During the wrap (live)

“Let me summarize what we have so far — stop me if I misrepresent anything.”

Write it down together (you type while you talk).

Written summary (shared live or sent after)

Snapshot

Current situation:

What you’re aiming for (near-term):

Must-haves (what good work needs to include):

Constraints (timeline/bandwidth/location/financial stability):

Promising directions (2–4)
For each direction:

Direction (1 sentence):

Why it might fit (1–2 bullets):

Next steps (1–2 low-cost steps):

Resources / links to support the next steps

Go through the next steps and list any relevant links/resources you should send (no fixed limit).

Rule of thumb: links exist to make next steps easier, not as extra reading.

People to talk to / intros (if any)

Door open

“If questions come up after you digest this, feel free to message.”

Optional: “If it would help, we can do a check-in later.”

Cause-area quick-start page template (locked)

Cause area name:

What this area is trying to achieve (2–4 lines, plain language)

What kinds of work exist here (role shapes, not org names)

What a “good fit” often looks like (signals, not requirements)

Experiments (pick the ones that fit the person)

Experiment A — 1-hour overview: broad overview + interest test; canonical intro resource/video (1–2 options)

Experiment B — longer exposure: course/fellowship/series; field granularity (1–2 options)

Experiment C — project pathway: hands-on; proof-of-fit; motivation-from-action; also good for people needing a push / impostor syndrome

Experiment D — job-board exploration: make roles/orgs concrete + bridge theory→action (boards + quick scan method)

Go-to recommendations (2–6 cards)

Who to talk to (intro types + 3 questions max)

Common confusions (optional)
