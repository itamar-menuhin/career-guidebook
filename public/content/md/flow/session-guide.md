## Session Outcomes

- **Directional Clarity**: Identify 3–6 plausible directions. Focus on exploring options, not finding "the one" answer yet.
- **Renewed Energy**: They leave feeling capable and excited ("this is doable").
- **Concrete Experiments**: Define 1–2 low-cost experiments **per direction** to test the waters, verify fit, or resolve key uncertainties.
- **Actionable Support**: A written summary, plus specific links or warm introductions **if meaningful**.

## Facilitator Stance

- **Think Partner, Not Guru**: You don't need all the answers. Your role is to help them think better, not to tell them what to do.
- **Scout Mindset**: Explore the terrain together. Build hypotheses and look for evidence, rather than defending a position.
- **Embrace Uncertainty**: It's okay to say "I don't know." Pivot the conversation to: *How could we find out?*

## Standard operating flow (60–90 minutes)

### Before the meeting

**Context Gathering**: Ask open-ended questions like "What helps me prepare?" or "What is on your mind?" to allow them to set the agenda without rigid homework.

### During the meeting

#### Understanding the candidate (~30 minutes)

##### Opening & Alignment

**Goal**: Establish rapport and understand their current reality.

**Prompts**:
- "What’s been on your mind regarding your career lately?"
- "What would make this conversation a success for you?"
- "Where should we focus our energy today?"



**Facilitator notes**:
- **Listen for Signal**: Use their opening answer to calibrate—do they need space to vent, or are they ready to problem-solve?
- **It's Okay to Be Vague**: If they don't have a clear goal yet, that's normal. Discovering the goal *is* the goal of the session.
- **Check the Clock**: Aim for ~5 minutes here so you have ample time for the deep dive.

##### Your current path

**Goal**: Understand their "default path"—where they have been, what they are building, and where they are going *if we do nothing today*.

###### What you are doing now
- "Main role/occupation?"
- "What do you actually **do** week-to-week (tasks, not titles)?"

###### What you are good at
- "What have you done that you’re proud of (even small)?"
- "What do people consistently come to you for?"
- "If I watched you work for a day, what would I see you doing well?"
- "Which skills do you want to use vs build this year?"

###### Your current plan
- "What’s your current plan right now? (even if it’s fuzzy)"
- "What are the next steps you’re already taking — applications, courses, conversations?"

###### Facilitator notes
- **Evidence over Claims**: Don't just take their word for it; ask for concrete examples ("When did you use that?").
- **Capture Transferable Strengths**: Look for skills that apply across domains, not just what is valid in their current role.

###### Mini-Exercise: Rapid Strength Mapping (2 Minutes)

*List at least 2 items per category.*

- **Hard Skills**: e.g. programming / data analysis, writing / editing, teaching / training, visual design / illustration, project management / events, research / lab techniques, financial/ops planning, policy/legal writing, founding ventures, etc
- **Soft Skills**: e.g. strategic thinking, good at instruction, stakeholder communication, initiative without supervision, organizing complex tasks, prioritization under pressure, rapid learning of new fields, etc
- **Unconventional Assets**: e.g. deep niche knowledge, access to niche community, multi-cultural/lingual exp., public visibility / strong online platform, exp. in high-speed/risk environments, etc

##### What Makes You Happy

**Goal**: Identify work that energizes you and conditions that support long-term well-being.

###### Operating Parameters
- "What are your preferences regarding **Context Switching** (focused vs switching), **Clarity** (defined vs exploratory), **Collaboration** (independent vs live), and **Pace** (calm vs urgent)?"

###### Ways of "Doing Good"
- "Which ways of 'doing good' feel most satisfying? e.g. direct work with people, research/analysis, building tools, founding, ops/logistics, funding, advocacy, teaching/mentoring, etc."

###### What Satisfies You
- "Can you give me examples of times you felt engaged, satisfied, or proud? What exactly was satisfying about that? (Isolating the driver)"
- "Do you need a strong technical challenge to feel fulfilled?"
- "Do you need the work itself to be the impact, or can it just fund the impact?"

###### What Pulls You In
- "Are there causes you feel pulled toward reading about or solving?"
- "If you were 'doing good' professionally, what daily work would excite you?"

###### What Helps You Thrive
- "What environments/pace help you feel balanced?"
- "What do you need weekly to remain stable?"
- "What reliably drains you?"



##### Reality Check

**Goal**: Defined the "Boundary Conditions" for the next step.

###### The Logistics
- "Location: What’s realistic? (Local only, remote, hybrid, temporary relocation, full relocation? Any specific constraints on where?)"
- "Bandwidth: What can you give? (A few hours/week, a dedicated sprint, or full-time focus?)"
- "Timeline: What’s the horizon? (Need something soon vs exploring for 6–12 months?)"

###### The Scope of Change
- "Openness to Change: How big a change are you open to? (e.g. small adjustment, org switch, adjacent move, or full career switch?)"
- "Impact Pathway: What paths are you open to? (e.g. direct work, operations/support, research, founding, or earning to give?)"

###### The Risk Profile
- "Risk Tolerance: Do you need stability right now, or are you open to uncertainty?"
- "Openness to Entrepreneurship: Where do you stand? (not for me, maybe in future, open to it, or very exciting?)"

#### The Hypothesis Loop (~30 minutes)

**Goal**: Surface 3–6 promising directions and identify a concrete, low-cost experiment for each.

**1. Prioritize Candidate Ideas**
- *Why:* Internal motivation is the strongest fuel.
- *The Stance:* Ride with it. If they have a lead, optimize it ("How could we make this even more impactful?"). A flawed idea they own is often better than a perfect idea they ignore.

**2. Pitch New Ideas**
- **Interesting Field**: Highlight roles in fields or cause areas they are already naturally curious about.
- **'No Consequences' Scenario**: Surface the dream project or role they would attempt if failure wasn't a risk.
- **Synthesizing the Profile**: Connect the dots between their mapped strengths, happiness drivers, and current path.
- **External Consultant**: Offer the "obvious" path a neutral observer would see in their background.
- **Pathways & Action Cards**: Use the cards and pathways to prompt lateral thinking and uncover new possibilities.

**3. Read the Reaction (The Learning)**
- *Spark:* Great, lock it down and move on.
- *Resistance:* **Curiosity, not convincing.** Don't push; probe.
    - *Misunderstanding?* "What does that role look like in your head?" (Correct the map).
    - *Fixable Element?* "I like the impact but hate the location." (Can we tweak parameters?).
    - *Underqualified?* "I'm not ready for that." (Confidence gap? Turn the "impossible" leap into a roadmap).
    - *Deep Preference?* "I hate the idea of fundraising." (Crucial signal! Use this to adjust future ideas).

**4. The Experiment Framework (Select the right depth)**
- Don't test the career; test the hypothesis. Start with the lowest friction step that gives valid signal.
    - **Quick Taste (<1 hour)**: Read an article, watch a talk, listen to a podcast. (Test: Is the topic interesting?)
    - **Deeper Dive**: Take a short course, apply for a fellowship, speak to a practitioner. (Test: Do I want to go deeper?)
    - **Hands On**: Join a project, volunteer, run a small trial. (Test: Do I enjoy the actual work/impact?)
    - **Job Board Scan**: Look at actual job descriptions. (Test: Does the reality match the fantasy?)

**Outcome**:
- By the end, you usually have **3–6 promising directions**, each with **1–2 small next steps** already identified during testing.

#### The Wrap (Closing the Loop)

**Goal**: Leave no ambiguity. They should see their own thoughts organized and actionable.

**1. The Readback (Candidate Writes)**
- *The Move:* "To make sure we captured everything, can you open a doc and type out the summary while saying it aloud? I'll catch anything we miss."
- *Why:* When *they* write it, they own it. Speaking aloud allows you to course-correct ("Oh, don't forget the intro to Sarah").

**2. The Artifact (The Written Summary)**
- **The Snapshot**: One paragraph synthesizing their key drivers, operating parameters, and risk profile.
- **The Plan**: 3–6 Directions. For each, list:
    - *The Hypothesis:* Why this path?
    - *The Tests:* 1–2 concrete steps (e.g. read X, talk to Y, draft Z).

**3. Clear Follow-ups**
- **Your Homework**: Explicitly state what *you* owe them (Links to specific resources, Intros to specific people).
- **The Next Loop**: Set a trigger. "Should we put a 15-min check-in on the calendar for 6 weeks from now?"
