## What "good" looks like

By the end of the session, the person leaves with:

- Clarity on 2–4 plausible directions (not 1)
- Energy (felt sense: "this is doable")
- Concrete next steps: 1–2 low-cost experiments per direction
- A written summary + links + intros/contacts as relevant

## Core stance

- "Mutual think tank," not "advisor with answers"
- You're building career hypotheses and testing plans, not making a forever decision.
- You're allowed to say "I'm not sure" and pivot to: who to ask / what to test / what to read next.

## Standard operating flow (60–90 minutes)

### Before the meeting

Short intake form to save time and reduce blank-page stress.

### During the meeting

#### Understanding the candidate (~30 minutes)

##### Opening & goal for today

**Goal**: Set the stage and align on what this session will achieve.

**Prompts**:
- What's on your mind today — what brought you here?
- What would make this conversation a success for you?
- Is there anything specific you want to cover or any outcome you're hoping for?

**Facilitator notes**:
- Keep this brief (5 min max).
- Use their answer to calibrate depth for the rest of the session.
- If they're vague, that's okay — you'll discover focus as you go.

##### What you bring

**Goal**: a grounded snapshot of skills, credibility, preferences, and current trajectory + their current plan and next steps.

**Prompts**:
- What’s your current role + what do you actually do week to week?
- What have you done that you’re proud of (even small)?
- What do people consistently come to you for?
- If I watched you work for a day, what would I see you doing well?
- Which skills do you want to use vs build this year?
- What’s your current plan right now? (even if it’s fuzzy)
- What are the next steps you’re already taking — applications, courses, conversations, projects?

**Mini-exercise (2–3 min): Skill stack (goal = 8 items)**
List 8 items total, with at least 2 in each:
- Hard skills (≥2)
- Soft skills (≥2)
- “Weird advantages” / uncommon assets (≥2)
- (the remaining 2 can go anywhere)

**Facilitator notes**:
- Don’t over-index on self-assessment; ask for concrete examples/evidence.
- Capture transferable strengths explicitly.

##### What you want / what feels satisfying

**Goal**: understand what a “good life + good work” looks like for them: intrinsic qualities their plan must include, what is satisfying day-to-day, and what causes/problems they want to contribute to.

**Prompts**:
- Why are you here today — what are you hoping changes after this conversation?
- Can you give me a few examples of times you felt engaged, satisfied, or proud? (work, studies, volunteering, side projects, tiny “baby projects”) What exactly was satisfying about each?
- Are there causes or problem areas you feel pulled toward? What about them specifically?
- Do you want your day-to-day work to be directly connected to helping, or can indirect impact (donations/volunteering/support roles) also feel satisfying?
- What kinds of contributions feel meaningful to you (building, research, teaching, organizing, influencing decisions, supporting a team, etc.)?

**Intrinsic must-haves (guidelines for a good life)**
- Do you need a strong technical/research challenge as part of daily work to feel fulfilled?
- Would donation satisfy the philanthropic/meaning need, or do you need your work itself to be “on mission”? (or some mix)
- People vs alone: what balance makes you thrive?
- Pace/environment: stability vs intensity; structured vs ambiguous; long feedback loops vs quick iterations.
- What reliably drains you, even if the goal is important?

**Summarize**:
- Meaning / cause pull
- What satisfying work feels like
- Must-haves
- Strong avoidances

##### Constraints + degrees of freedom

**Instructor-only purpose**: map what’s realistic right now (and what might be realistic later) so ideas match their life situation.

**Candidate-facing one-liner (optional)**: “Quick logistics map so we aim at options that actually fit your life.”

**Prompts with gentle option scaffolding**:
- What kind of change is on the table right now (staying put / switching org same lane / shifting function / bigger field change)?
- Location-wise, what’s realistic (only local / remote-only / hybrid / short trips / temporary relocation for a program / full relocation)?
- What bandwidth do you have (a couple hours a week / serious push for a month / basically none right now)?
- What’s your timeline (need something soon / exploring while employed for 6–12 months / planning bigger change after a milestone)?
- Do you need the next step to be very stable, or is there some room for uncertainty?
- What level of ambiguity feels okay vs draining?
- How do you feel about starting something (project/org/startup)—from “nope” to “maybe later” to “exciting”?
- Impact pathway: work itself on-mission vs donations/volunteering vs unsure.

#### Iterative direction testing (~30 minutes)

**The loop (how directions get tested and narrowed)**

For each direction that comes up (yours or theirs):
- Name it simply (one sentence)
- Test fit quickly (strengths, must-haves, constraints/timeline)
- Find a toe-in-the-water step immediately (ideally ≤60 minutes)
- Read reaction (spark / neutral / no)
- Adjust / pivot / park it
- If it’s promising, keep it; if not, drop it without drama
- By the end you usually have 2–4 promising directions, each with 1–2 small next steps already identified during testing.

#### Wrap + written summary (~10 minutes)

##### During the wrap (live)

- “Let me summarize what we have so far — stop me if I misrepresent anything.”
- Write it down together (you type while you talk).
- **Door open**: “If questions come up after you digest this, feel free to message.” (Optional: “If it would help, we can do a check-in later.”)

##### Written summary details

**Snapshot**
- Current situation
- What you’re aiming for (near-term)
- Must-haves (what good work needs to include)
- Constraints (timeline/bandwidth/location/financial stability)
- Promising directions (2–4)

**For each direction**:
- Direction (1 sentence)
- Why it might fit (1–2 bullets)
- Next steps (1–2 low-cost steps)

**Resources / links to support the next steps**
- Go through the next steps and list any relevant links/resources you should send (no fixed limit).
- Rule of thumb: links exist to make next steps easier, not as extra reading.

**People to talk to / intros (if any)**

**People to talk to / intros (if any)**

### After the meeting

If anything wasn't written during the wrap: send the summary + links/resources + intros.
