## Goal
a grounded snapshot of skills, credibility, preferences, and current trajectory + their current plan and next steps.
## High-yield prompts
- What’s your current role + what do you actually do week to week?
- What have you done that you’re proud of (even small)?
- What do people consistently come to you for?
- If I watched you work for a day, what would I see you doing well?
- Which skills do you want to use vs build this year?
- What’s your current plan right now? (even if it’s fuzzy)
- What are the next steps you’re already taking — applications, courses, conversations, projects?
## Mini-exercise (2–3 min): Skill stack (goal = 8 items)
List 8 items total, with at least 2 in each:

- Hard skills (≥2)
- Soft skills (≥2)
- “Weird advantages” / uncommon assets (≥2)
- (the remaining 2 can go anywhere)
## Facilitator notes
- Don’t over-index on self-assessment; ask for concrete examples/evidence.
- Capture transferable strengths explicitly.
