## propose a direction (or they propose)

## test fit quickly (strengths, motivation, constraints)

## immediately find 1 low-cost “toe in the water” step

## read reaction (enthusiasm / resistance / confusion)

## adjust / pivot / narrow

## “lock in” 2–4 promising directions as you go

as you lock in each direction, you also lock in 1–2 next steps

## Wrap + written summary (5–10 min)

## recap the directions + next steps you locked in

write it down together (live notes, or you type while summarizing)

make sure the next steps feel clear, low-pressure, and doable

## follow-up plan (optional)

After-call (optional)
If anything wasn’t written during the wrap: send the summary + links/resources + intros.

## 4) Chapter 1 — What they bring to the table

Goal: a grounded snapshot of skills, credibility, preferences, and current trajectory + their current plan and next steps.

## High-yield prompts

What’s your current role + what do you actually do week to week?

What have you done that you’re proud of (even small)?

What do people consistently come to you for?

If I watched you work for a day, what would I see you doing well?

Which skills do you want to use vs build this year?

## What’s your current plan right now? (even if it’s fuzzy)

What are the next steps you’re already taking — applications, courses, conversations, projects?

Mini-exercise (2–3 min): Skill stack (goal = 8 items)
List 8 items total, with at least 2 in each:

## Hard skills (≥2)

## Soft skills (≥2)

“Weird advantages” / uncommon assets (≥2)
(the remaining 2 can go anywhere)

## Facilitator notes

Don’t over-index on self-assessment; ask for concrete examples/evidence.

Capture transferable strengths explicitly.

## 5) Chapter 2 — What would make them happy

Goal: understand what a “good life + good work” looks like for them: intrinsic qualities their plan must include, what is satisfying day-to-day, and what causes/problems they want to contribute to.

## Prompts

Why are you here today — what are you hoping changes after this conversation?

Can you give me a few examples of times you felt engaged, satisfied, or proud? (work, studies, volunteering, side projects, tiny “baby projects”) What exactly was satisfying about each?

Are there causes or problem areas you feel pulled toward? What about them specifically?

Do you want your day-to-day work to be directly connected to helping, or can indirect impact (donations/volunteering/support roles) also feel satisfying?

What kinds of contributions feel meaningful to you (building, research, teaching, organizing, influencing decisions, supporting a team, etc.)?

## Intrinsic must-haves (guidelines for a good life)

Do you need a strong technical/research challenge as part of daily work to feel fulfilled?

Would donation satisfy the philanthropic/meaning need, or do you need your work itself to be “on mission”? (or some mix)

People vs alone: what balance makes you thrive?

Pace/environment: stability vs intensity; structured vs ambiguous; long feedback loops vs quick iterations.

What reliably drains you, even if the goal is important?

## Summarize (write down)

## Meaning / cause pull

## What satisfying work feels like

## Must-haves

## Strong avoidances

## 6) Chapter 3 — Constraints & degrees of freedom

Instructor-only purpose: map what’s realistic right now (and what might be realistic later) so ideas match their life situation.

Candidate-facing one-liner (optional):
“Quick logistics map so we aim at options that actually fit your life.”

## Prompts with gentle option scaffolding

What kind of change is on the table right now (staying put / switching org same lane / shifting function / bigger field change)?

Location-wise, what’s realistic (only local / remote-only / hybrid / short trips / temporary relocation for a program / full relocation)?

What bandwidth do you have (a couple hours a week / serious push for a month / basically none right now)?

What’s your timeline (need something soon / exploring while employed for 6–12 months / planning bigger change after a milestone)?

Do you need the next step to be very stable, or is there some room for uncertainty?

What level of ambiguity feels okay vs draining?

How do you feel about starting something (project/org/startup)—from “nope” to “maybe later” to “exciting”?

Impact pathway: work itself on-mission vs donations/volunteering vs unsure.

## 7–8) Iterative direction testing + direction library

## The loop (how directions get tested and narrowed)

For each direction that comes up (yours or theirs):

## Name it simply (one sentence)

Test fit quickly (strengths, must-haves, constraints/timeline)

Find a toe-in-the-water step immediately (ideally ≤60 minutes)

## Read reaction (spark / neutral / no)

## Adjust / pivot / park it

## If it’s promising, keep it; if not, drop it without drama

By the end you usually have 2–4 promising directions, each with 1–2 small next steps already identified during testing.

## Layer 1: Generic “path patterns” menu (cause-agnostic)

Use these when you don’t have deep domain answers, or cause area isn’t clear yet:

## Stay in role but reshape it

## Switch org/team within same field

## Adjacent function shift

## Career change

## Skill-building plan (career capital)

## “Test the cause area” plan

## Credentials/pipeline plan

## Project-first plan

## Volunteering/community plan

## Entrepreneurship plan

## Earning-to-give/support role plan

## Networking/exposure sprint (when stuck)

## Layer 2: Cause-area quick-start menus (cause-specific)

One page per cause area, with:

## Role types in the area

Experiments A–D (overview → longer exposure → project pathway → job-board exploration)

## 2–6 go-to recommendations (cards)

## “Who to talk to” (intro types + 3 questions)

## Orthogonal modules (cross-cutting, not cause-specific)

Used as additional options when they fit:

## Effective giving

## Entrepreneurship / founding

## Volunteering/community building

## Skill-building / career capital

## Job search / networking sprint

## Project-first (create an artifact)

## Recommendation Card template (locked)
