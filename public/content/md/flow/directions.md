7–8) Iterative direction testing + direction library

The loop (how directions get tested and narrowed)

For each direction that comes up (yours or theirs):

Name it simply (one sentence)

Test fit quickly (strengths, must-haves, constraints/timeline)

Find a first small step (≤60 min) step immediately (ideally ≤60 minutes)

Read reaction (spark / neutral / no)

Adjust / pivot / park it

If it’s promising, keep it; if not, drop it without drama

By the end you usually have 2–4 promising directions, each with 1–2 small next steps already identified during testing.

Layer 1: Generic “path patterns” menu (cause-agnostic)

Use these when you don’t have deep domain answers, or cause area isn’t clear yet:

Stay in role but reshape it

Switch org/team within same field

Adjacent function shift

Career change

Skill-building plan (career capital)

“Test the cause area” plan

Credentials/pipeline plan

Project-first plan

Volunteering/community plan

Entrepreneurship plan

Earning-to-give/support role plan

Networking/exposure sprint (when stuck)

Layer 2: Cause-area quick-start menus (cause-specific)

One page per cause area, with:

Role types in the area

Experiments A–D (overview → longer exposure → project pathway → job-board exploration)

2–6 go-to recommendations (cards)

“Who to talk to” (intro types + 3 questions)

Orthogonal modules (cross-cutting, not cause-specific)

Used as additional options when they fit:

Effective giving

Entrepreneurship / founding

Volunteering/community building

Skill-building / career capital

Job search / networking sprint

Project-first (create an artifact)

Recommendation Card template (locked)
