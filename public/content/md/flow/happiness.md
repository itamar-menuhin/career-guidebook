Goal: understand what a “good life + good work” looks like for them: intrinsic qualities their plan must include, what is satisfying day-to-day, and what causes/problems they want to contribute to.

Prompts

Why are you here today — what are you hoping changes after this conversation?

Can you give me a few examples of times you felt engaged, satisfied, or proud? (work, studies, volunteering, side projects, tiny “baby projects”) What exactly was satisfying about each?

Are there causes or problem areas you feel pulled toward? What about them specifically?

Do you want your day-to-day work to be directly connected to helping, or can indirect impact (donations/volunteering/support roles) also feel satisfying?

What kinds of contributions feel meaningful to you (building, research, teaching, organizing, influencing decisions, supporting a team, etc.)?

Intrinsic must-haves (guidelines for a good life)

Do you need a strong technical/research challenge as part of daily work to feel fulfilled?

Would donation satisfy the philanthropic/meaning need, or do you need your work itself to be “on mission”? (or some mix)

People vs alone: what balance makes you thrive?

Pace/environment: stability vs intensity; structured vs ambiguous; long feedback loops vs quick iterations.

What reliably drains you, even if the goal is important?
