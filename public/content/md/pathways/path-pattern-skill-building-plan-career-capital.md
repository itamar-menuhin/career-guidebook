**Goal:** Focus on acquiring a "missing piece" to unlock future options.

**When to suggest:**
- They know *what* they want to do but lack a specific hard skill (e.g. "I want to do bio-risk but don't know biology").
- They are "undecided" on a cause but want to be generally useful (flexible career capital).
- They are currently in a "study phase" (university) and want to optimize their electives/thesis.

**The Move:** Treat the skill acquisition as the primary job. Identify the "gold standard" credential or portfolio piece for that skill.
*   *Examples:* Learning ML engineering; Improving writing/communication; Management experience.

**First Small Step:** Find a syllabus or a "roadmap" for this skill (e.g. "What does a junior ML engineer need to know?") and map their current gaps.
