**Goal:** Deeply re-orienting their career toward a high-priority problem.

**When to suggest:**

- Their current path doesn't have a direct route to the impact they want (dead end).
- They are willing to invest time in learning new skills (bootcamps, degrees, self-study).
- They are early in their career OR have skills that translate well (e.g. coding, data, writing).

**The Move:** Identify the entry point.
*   *Transitional Skills:* Using existing hard skills in a new domain (e.g. Cybersecurity → InfoSec; Data Science → Policy Analysis).
*   *Junior Entry:* Entering a field where general capacity/grit matters more than specific experience (e.g. Operations, Generalist roles).

**First Small Step:** Pick one "Quick Taste" activity (read an article, watch a talk) for the *new* field. Verify the interest is real before planning the big switch.
