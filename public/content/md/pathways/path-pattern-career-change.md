**Goal:** Start a new path in a field better suited to your values.

**When to use:**

- Strong mismatch between current work and values.
- You feel it's right to "start fresh".
- You have stability/runway.

**The Move:** Choose a new direction and start building foundations (skills, experience, network).

**Small First Step:** Identify 2–3 roles in the new field. What skills are needed? Make a learning plan. **Bonus:** Talk to someone who switched "from zero".
