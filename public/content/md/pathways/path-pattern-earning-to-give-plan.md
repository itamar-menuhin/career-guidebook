**Goal:** Maximize impact through funding the most effective work.

**When to suggest:**

- They have high earning potential (Quant, Tech, Law) but maybe lower "fit" for direct research/policy work.
- They prefer a career with clear metrics and stability over the ambiguity of direct impact roles.
- They want to contribute heavily but "keep their career their own".

**The Move:** Optimize for **Counterfactual Impact** and build **Giving Literacy**.
*   Don't just earn; learn *where* to give. Engage with organizations like "Giving What We Can".

**First Small Step:** Take a "Trial Pledge" (e.g. 1% for a month) or research one specific high-impact fund to understand exactly where the money goes.
