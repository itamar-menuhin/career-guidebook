**The Move:** The "Immersion Sprint". Commit to 2 weeks of efficiently getting up to speed on the core arguments and open questions. Treat it like a mini-research project.

**First Small Step:** Read a core "Problem Profile" (e.g. from 80,000 Hours or a specialist site) and write down 3 specific questions you would want to solve if you worked in this field.
