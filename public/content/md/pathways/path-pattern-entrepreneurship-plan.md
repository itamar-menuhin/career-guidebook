**Goal:** Explore the "Founder" path by testing high-agency traits.

**When to suggest:**

- They are **open to the idea** of starting something, even if they don't identify as a "Founder" yet.
- They have relevant traits: high self-motivation, strong people skills, and a desire for large-scale impact.
- They see a gap but aren't sure if they are the one to fill it.

**The Move:** Two tracks:
*   **The MVP Sprint:** Don't start a company; start a defined, time-bound project where *you* are the final decision maker.
*   **The Support Track:** Join an incubator or builder (e.g. AIM) that provides the ideas/team/structure for you to execute on.

**First Small Step:** **Define & Research**:
1.  Draft a simple "MVP Spec" (1 page): What is the core problem and the simplest solution?
2.  Watch an intro webinar or read the "Selection Criteria" for a charity incubator (like AIM) to see what they look for.
