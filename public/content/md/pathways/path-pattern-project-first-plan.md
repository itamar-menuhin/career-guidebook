**Goal:** Build a "Proof of Work" portfolio to signal high agency and creativity.

**When to suggest:**
- They learn best by building, not reading.
- They have a "cold start" (no network/credentials) but need to stand out from the crowd.
- **Signaling:** They want to prove they have the drive to work independently and generate novel solutions.

**The Move:** Ignore the "job hunt" for 2 weeks. Ship one concrete artifact (a tool, a replication, a deep analysis).
*   *The Signal:* "I don't just follow instructions; I identify problems and solve them."

**First Small Step:** Define the "Unit of Reputation": What is the smallest thing you could ship this weekend that would make a hiring manager say, "Wow, who built this?"
