**Goal:** Deploy **existing skills "as is"** but in a higher-impact environment.

**When to suggest:**
- They are already good at what they do (e.g. Researcher, Ops) but are in a low-impact organization.
- They have the "career capital" to qualify for a priority organization immediately.
- "Right skills, wrong place."

**The Move:** Port their proven track record to a better vehicle (a more effective org or high-priority team) without changing their day-to-day work.

**First Small Step:** Identify the "gap" between their current org and a "target org"—what is the one thing they need to add to their CV to make the jump?
