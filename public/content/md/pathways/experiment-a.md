**Goal:** Test interest in a new field with minimal commitment (<1 hour).

**When to suggest:**
- They are curious about a field but have low certainty.
- They are overwhelmed and don't know where to start.
- You want to see if the "logic" of a cause area clicks with them.

**The Move:** Help them pick **one** canonical piece of media. Avoid general lists; instead, send a specific Problem Profile or high-signal introduction.

**First Small Step:** Send the link and ask: "Does the logic of this problem feel like something you want to spend more time on?"
