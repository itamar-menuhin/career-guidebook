**Goal:** Test "fit" and feel direct impact by actually doing the work.

**When to suggest:**

- They have high interest but low certainty of skill-fit.
- They need a "proof of work" artifact for their portfolio/CV.
- They are motivated by seeing immediate, tangible results.

**The Move:** Identify a project with a clear, specific output.
- **Candidate-led:** If they have an idea, optimize it for impact and scope.
- **Advisor-led:** Use intro videos or websites from external project curators/mentors. They can often pitch the value and mission better than an advisor can. Ensure the project matches the candidate's bandwidth and skills.

**First Small Step:** Watch one "intro video" from a project curator or go through a list of project prompts to see which activities spark interest.
