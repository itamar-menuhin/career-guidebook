## Job-board scan — make it concrete
- **Scan:** 80,000 Hours job board OR AISafety.com.
- **The Exercise (Role Clustering):**
    1.  Select 5 roles that sound vaguely interesting.
    2.  Ignore the "Titles".
    3.  Highlight the *day-to-day tasks* (e.g. "write python tests", "policy memo drafting").
    4.  Group them: Do you prefer the **Building** tasks or the **Writing/Strategy** tasks?
