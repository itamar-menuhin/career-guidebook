## What it’s trying to achieve (plain language)
Reduce catastrophic biological risks (natural outbreaks and engineered pathogens) by improving prevention, detection, response, and policy—so society is far less vulnerable to extreme pandemics. 80,000 Hours+1

## What kinds of work exist here (role shapes)
- Public health security / policy / strategy
- Technical work (biosurveillance, diagnostics, PPE/engineering controls, forecasting)
- Research & analysis (risk assessment, program evaluation, modeling)
- Ops/programs (running initiatives, coordination, funding ops)
- AI-bio risk work (when relevant) 80,000 Hours

## What a good fit often looks like (signals)
- Motivated by preparedness + systems thinking (institutions, incentives, coordination)
- Comfortable with policy/bureaucracy and/or technical public health work
- Often benefits from “make it concrete” steps (projects, job-board scan), because the space can feel abstract

## Experiments (A–D)
Experiment A — 1-hour overview (choose 1)
80,000 Hours Biorisk research, strategy & policy career review (read/skim as an overview entry point). 80,000 Hours
YouTube talk (EA-context): Jaime Yassif (biosecurity / GCBRs) talk (good “field picture” overview). YouTube
Experiment B — longer exposure (choose 1)
BlueDot Impact — Biosecurity course (structured ~30h exposure). BlueDot+1
Optional alt: pick 1–2 episodes/articles from 80,000 Hours’ biosecurity materials for deeper texture (e.g., health security interviews, misconceptions series). 80,000 Hours+280,000 Hours+2
Experiment C — project pathway (make it concrete)
Canonical pick: Oxford Biosecurity Group (OBG) projects (part-time remote research projects; biosecurity + AI-bio intersection). My Site+1
Toe-in-the-water step: browse the projects page; pick 2 projects that seem feasible/interesting; write 2 lines each.
Experiment D — job-board exploration (choose 1–2)
80,000 Hours job board (filter toward biosecurity/pandemic preparedness roles). 80,000 Hours Job Board+1
Optional alt: EA Opportunities for events/fellowships/short programs in biosecurity. Effective Altruism
Tiny scanning method (10–25 min): same as AI safety (8–12 roles → label → circle 3 roles + 2 skill gaps).
