## What it’s trying to achieve (plain language)
Reduce catastrophic biological risks (natural outbreaks and engineered pathogens) by improving prevention, detection, response, and policy—so society is far less vulnerable to extreme pandemics. 80,000 Hours+1

## What kinds of work exist here
- Public health security / policy / strategy
- Technical work (biosurveillance, diagnostics, PPE/engineering controls, forecasting)
- Research & analysis (risk assessment, program evaluation, modeling)
- Ops/programs (running initiatives, coordination, funding ops)
- AI-bio risk work (when relevant) 80,000 Hours

## What a good fit often looks like (signals)
- Motivated by preparedness + systems thinking (institutions, incentives, coordination)
- Comfortable with policy/bureaucracy and/or technical public health work
- Often benefits from “make it concrete” steps (projects, job-board scan), because the space can feel abstract
