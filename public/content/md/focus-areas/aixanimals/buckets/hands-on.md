Canonical pick (low barrier, EA-aligned research contribution)

Use a Rethink Priorities “AI for animals” angle to produce a small artifact:

1–2 page scoping note (“which AI application + what welfare mechanism + what uncertainties?”)

or a lightweight literature/landscape map that could be shared with an org/funder. (Rethink Priorities)

## Canonical pick (concrete + clearly external)

Felidae Fund — volunteer AI/ML specialist processing camera imagery for animal population research (explicit volunteer role with real use). Felidae Conservation Fund+1

## Optional alt

Faunalytics volunteering (if the person’s contribution is in the “research tooling / analysis” lane that directly supports advocates). Faunalytics

## Toe-in-the-water next step (≤60 min)

Pick one subdomain (e.g., “wildlife conflict detection,” “aquaculture AI welfare risks,” “LLM research tooling for advocates”).

Find one anchor piece (from Experiment A/B), then write 10 bullets: “promising application → mechanism → biggest risk/unknown → what a small project could be.”

Best for: people who need action to stay motivated, want quick proof-of-fit, or need a push past impostor syndrome.

Here “measurable good” is often easiest via moving money effectively or creating a real-world mobilization, since many top orgs don’t offer easy small volunteer tasks.

## Canonical pick

Run a small fundraising/donation drive for GiveWell Top Charities / Top Charities Fund
Measurable outcome: $ donated (or matched) + number of donors. GiveWell explicitly routes donations to its recommended opportunities. GiveWell+2GiveWell+2

## Optional alt

GWWC Pledge Drive as a community action experiment (measurable: pledges taken + giving committed). Giving What We Can+1

Best for: people who need action early, want quick proof-of-fit, or need help bridging theory → concrete.

## Canonical pick

Work on Climate volunteering — explicitly recruits volunteers across functions (incl. research/data analytics), with the goal of mobilizing professionals into climate work. Work on Climate+1

## Optional alt

If the person is giving-inclined: a giving drive informed by Giving Green research (measurable: $ influenced / donated). Giving Green+1
