Experiment C — project pathway (make it concrete; good for “I need a push”)
Canonical pick (low barrier, EA-aligned research contribution)
Use a Rethink Priorities “AI for animals” angle to produce a small artifact:
1–2 page scoping note (“which AI application + what welfare mechanism + what uncertainties?”)
or a lightweight literature/landscape map that could be shared with an org/funder. (Rethink Priorities)
Canonical pick (concrete + clearly external)
Felidae Fund — volunteer AI/ML specialist processing camera imagery for animal population research (explicit volunteer role with real use). Felidae Conservation Fund+1
Optional alt
Faunalytics volunteering (if the person’s contribution is in the “research tooling / analysis” lane that directly supports advocates). Faunalytics
Toe-in-the-water next step (≤60 min)
Pick one subdomain (e.g., “wildlife conflict detection,” “aquaculture AI welfare risks,” “LLM research tooling for advocates”).
Find one anchor piece (from Experiment A/B), then write 10 bullets: “promising application → mechanism → biggest risk/unknown → what a small project could be.”
