## Canonical pick (evidence/field grounding)

Rethink Priorities series: “How AI is affecting farmed aquatic animals” (deep dive on innovation → deployment → welfare effects; very “EA research-y”). (Rethink Priorities)

## Optional alt (structured program)

AI×Animals Fellowship (8-week remote program focused on AI × animal welfare careers). (Effective Altruism)

Futurekind AI Fellowship (12-week program on using AI for animal protection & environment; listed on EA Opportunities). (Effective Altruism)
(These structured programs are newer; I’m including them because they’re explicitly advertised in EA channels, but they’re not as long-established as core 80k/AAC resources.) (Effective Altruism)

Choose 1:

(Non-EA but solid grounding) Coursera: An Introduction to Global Health (structured modules; builds vocabulary + systems map) (Coursera)

Crash Course playlist: Public Health (lighter but sticky; good for people who prefer video series) (YouTube)

Pick 1:

Terra.do — “Climate Change: Learning for Action” (structured 12-week “map the space + find your role” style). Terra+1

Project Drawdown — Climate Solutions 101 playlist (self-paced series, broad but concrete). YouTube
