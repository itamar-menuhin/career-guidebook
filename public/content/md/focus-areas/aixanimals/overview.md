## What it’s trying to achieve (plain language)
Use AI to reduce animal suffering (farmed and wild) by improving how we measure welfare, prevent harms, target advocacy, and design interventions — while also being careful about ways AI deployment can accidentally increase suffering (e.g., scale effects, mismeasurement, perverse incentives). (Animal Charity Evaluators)

## What kinds of work exist here (role shapes)
- Applied ML for wild animal welfare: human–wildlife conflict mitigation, monitoring welfare indicators (e.g., vocalizations), detection/early warning systems. (Rethink Priorities)
- AI in farmed animal systems: how AI in agriculture/aquaculture changes welfare (sometimes better, sometimes worse), plus interventions to steer it. (Rethink Priorities)
- AI for animal advocacy orgs: LLM-enabled research workflows, message testing, supporter comms, grantwriting support, ops automation (done carefully). (Faunalytics)
- Research & strategy at think tanks (what AI applications are promising, where are risks/unknowns). (Rethink Priorities)
- Programs / community / hackathons for building tools and pipelines for animal protection. (Electric Sheep)

## What a good fit often looks like (signals)
- You like concrete technical leverage (data/ML) and you’re motivated by animals.
- You’re comfortable with “applied + messy” domains (datasets, field conditions, imperfect metrics).
- You can hold a balanced stance: “AI can help” and “AI can harm if used carelessly.” (Animal Charity Evaluators)

## Experiments (A–D)
Experiment A — 1-hour overview (choose 1)
Canonical picks
Animal Charity Evaluators — “The impacts of AI on animal advocacy” (high-level framing of upsides/risks; good first map). (Animal Charity Evaluators)
Rethink Priorities — AI for human–wildlife conflict mitigations (concrete examples; “here’s what AI-for-animals can look like”). (Rethink Priorities)
Optional alt (if they want “how advocates already use AI”)
Faunalytics — “AI and Animal Advocacy” (survey-style view of current usage patterns). (Faunalytics)
Experiment B — longer exposure (choose 1)
Canonical pick (evidence/field grounding)
Rethink Priorities series: “How AI is affecting farmed aquatic animals” (deep dive on innovation → deployment → welfare effects; very “EA research-y”). (Rethink Priorities)
Optional alt (structured program)
AI×Animals Fellowship (8-week remote program focused on AI × animal welfare careers). (Effective Altruism)
Futurekind AI Fellowship (12-week program on using AI for animal protection & environment; listed on EA Opportunities). (Effective Altruism)
(These structured programs are newer; I’m including them because they’re explicitly advertised in EA channels, but they’re not as long-established as core 80k/AAC resources.) (Effective Altruism)
Experiment C — project pathway (make it concrete; good for “I need a push”)
Canonical pick (low barrier, EA-aligned research contribution)
Use a Rethink Priorities “AI for animals” angle to produce a small artifact:
1–2 page scoping note (“which AI application + what welfare mechanism + what uncertainties?”)
or a lightweight literature/landscape map that could be shared with an org/funder. (Rethink Priorities)
Canonical pick (concrete + clearly external)
Felidae Fund — volunteer AI/ML specialist processing camera imagery for animal population research (explicit volunteer role with real use). Felidae Conservation Fund+1
Optional alt
Faunalytics volunteering (if the person’s contribution is in the “research tooling / analysis” lane that directly supports advocates). Faunalytics
Toe-in-the-water next step (≤60 min)
Pick one subdomain (e.g., “wildlife conflict detection,” “aquaculture AI welfare risks,” “LLM research tooling for advocates”).
Find one anchor piece (from Experiment A/B), then write 10 bullets: “promising application → mechanism → biggest risk/unknown → what a small project could be.”
Experiment D — job-board exploration (bridge theory → action)
Canonical picks (choose 1–2)
80,000 Hours job board (filter for animal welfare, or AI/data roles in adjacent orgs).
Animal Advocacy Careers job board (search for data/tech roles; also helps you learn org landscape). (Animal Advocacy Careers)
Optional alt
EA Opportunities (often has fellowships/programs/projects that aren’t “jobs”). (Effective Altruism)
Tiny scanning method (10–25 min)
Collect 8–12 roles → label role type (ML / research / ops / policy) → circle 3 roles + 2 repeating skill gaps → turn that into a direction + next step.
