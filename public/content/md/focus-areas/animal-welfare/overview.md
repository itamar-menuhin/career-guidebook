## What it’s trying to achieve (plain language)
Reduce large-scale animal suffering — especially in areas where many animals are affected (e.g., factory farming), by changing policies, corporate practices, consumer behavior, and the systems that determine how animals are treated. 80,000 Hours+1

## What kinds of work exist here (role shapes)
- Campaigns & corporate outreach (commitments, implementation, accountability)
- Policy / legal / government relations
- Research & analysis (what works, which tactics, which species/interventions)
- Communications / storytelling / movement building
- Operations / management / fundraising (often a major bottleneck)
- Science/alt-protein/food systems (depending on the person)
- Animal x AI – different cause area

## What a good fit often looks like (signals)
- Strong “moral pull” toward animals + willingness to engage practical levers (institutions, corporations, policy)
- Comfort with advocacy, persuasion, and coordination (many roles are people-facing)
- Or: strong “evidence-minded” instinct (measurement, research, strategy) Faunalytics+1
